Stoehr is relied on as leading to a conclusion that a writ of habeas corpus in this case is barred by the eleventh section of the act of 1851, so far as is necessary to a review of the grounds on which it was decreed. The contention is that as a result of the execution of the judgment of the Circuit Court, an appeal was barred to this court, and the defendant's petition was dismissed. The ground of the appeal is, that the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed, because the judgment of the Circuit Court was not a final judgment, but an appeal from a final judgment.", "label": 0, "id": 15411}

The missile was detected by South Korean and American military officials, and it deviated from a normal trajectory. The missile was believed to be a Musudan, which is capable of carrying a 1.3-ton nuclear warhead and reaching US territory. North Korea has never tested this model of missile before. The failure is seen as an embarrassing blow to North Korea, but experts believe that they will learn from the experience.", "label": 0, "id": 17957}
