{"text": "It was 8am on a Sunday in April. Three of the six teams at the tournament had already dropped.\n\n\n\"Myself, I said, 'It's a great opportunity. If they go back to the table after that and come up with some new ideas, it could be something we could look at and see what it is and how to replicate that',\" McIlroy told ESPN.\n\n\nHe soon found out just how great a potential idea this would actually be.\n\n\n\"The idea was to have a more casual setting, less intense,\" McIlroy says. \"I don't know what went through their heads but after talking with them, it was, 'OK, this is a lot more fun.'\n\n\n\"When I got there, it was a very relaxed setting, very easy going, which I was able to use to my advantage. We talked at length about how to break things down and I ended up taking some away from that and putting it into the game.\"\n\n\nMcIlroy's idea of breaking things down was to have the players walk the course wearing a special jersey with the time on it showing the score of each hole and one of five players with an \"X\" next to their name.\n\n\n\"You walked on and shot and could see where each player ranked against the other, where you were compared to them and where you should improve on your game,\" says McIlroy. \"The kids loved it. They loved the fact they could see what they were doing and know where their strengths were and where they needed to improve to get ready for the next round.\"\n\n\nThe players also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a pair of instructors that McIlroy knew would be supportive and eager to work with them.\n\n\n\"One of them was a guy that had won before and is a great teacher,\" McIlroy says. \"The other guy was a really good friend of mine who I hadn't seen in a while and was an instructor. I thought they were great to just come over and play with in an informal setting. It ended up being a really fun environment. It wasn't like a competition.\"\n\n\nThe idea was that the players could go back to practice over the summer months and then on Nov. 17 at Trump National Doral in Miami, they would play a final round at Trump National with the results being tallied up.\n\n\nIt sounds like an ideal outcome, but when McIlroy arrived there was one problem.\n\n\n\"I wasn't informed of it in advance,\" he says. \"I saw the players in their clothes the Monday before and there was absolutely NO instruction. I was surprised. I came in just a little bit overconfident. The first half of the week there was like, 'What do we do? Should we play something or stop and do something?'\n\n\n\"Finally, I made the call and said, 'All right, time's over and we can start it now.' No need to worry about it further. There was something in the works, no need to worry about it at that point.\"\n\n\nInstead, the players spent the rest of the week with McIlroy working on his game. And while the first few holes were pretty easy, the competition got tougher from there.\n\n\n\"I played really hard that week,\" McIlroy says. \"I was just playing around, not trying to be nervous or anything, just trying to do what I thought was right and trying to understand that we were still not fully on our feet from last week. I could feel it at the end of every week. I could feel it the day of the first round at the tournament.\"\n\n\nMcIlroy ended up finishing eighth. The players he played weren't as well known as some of the competitors that had won at the past three tournaments, which made them difficult to beat.\n\n\nHe also lost to Tommy Fleetwood on the last hole. But in the two weeks that he spent there, he learned a lot.\n\n\nAnd it is those lessons that have helped him prepare for the next two trips he will take to California for the US Golf Championship and the Tour Championship.\n\n\nLast week, he made the decision to come back a final time to prepare for the U.S. Open next month, and if he keeps his pace and wins there that will certainly make him a better player.\n\n\n\"I thought it was well worthwhile, honestly,\" he says. \"The lesson that I take away from this experience is to not look at the other things that may or may not be important to me.\n\n\n\"The things that matter to me are the things that are important to me as a golfer. What are my strengths, what am I doing that I can improve on in my game? I think it's a lot of things to it. The golf part of it is just another part of that whole game.

I would never have a girlfriend/boyfriend that doesn't understand the things i do for him and also for the wrong reasons. My \"bff\" would be like a little kid without parents to show them the stuff we do and why we do it. I'm trying really hard to keep all the bad stuff out of the public view, you know?\n\n(II) How long have you worked for Reddit?\n\n(III) Was there an official program set up to ensure a female performer could do her AMA's during this season as they did in the last few years?\n\n(IV) Have you personally done an AMA before?

When we asked to look into the matter, we got this response:\n\nTo: [redacted]\n\nFrom:\n\nMy friend and fellow former employee, [redacted], just called me...I am just going to start from the beginning - let me tell you this: I have known redditors for many years, mostly young guys. I know that they're all young men who are into gaming, reddit.com, etc. I'm sure they'd love to have me. I'm going to say that about 75% of redditors are female. But I have a great experience with most of them too.\n\n[Redacted] has done over 100 AMAs in various forms of media and in several niches. But the main job of \"her,\" is to be their female friend/professional/friend and to look out for them, and keep them safe. I know this sounds strange.\n\nLet me give you some examples: When I used to work at Reddit, I had a female coworker who was a professional gamer. One day reddit got a post about a hacker who was stealing money from users (this is the real story behind the story, I can't link it because there is a court case pending), and they wanted all their employees to help with that issue. Since it was a new issue of stealing money, she sent the reddit team an email. She talked about how she wanted to volunteer her time in a different subreddit in order to handle these issues, get the word out about it, and encourage other users here at reddit to make their own accounts and help with this. When I asked her what other reddit subs she volunteered in before, there were over 4 in the community.\n\nWhen redditor who's name I forgot tried to tell her about how he had been hacked too (a reddit post), reddit user \"r/AskReddit\" came to his post and took note of that. One of the admins I talked to told me that I was a great guy to volunteer for that. It was his responsibility. I know this sounds weird and I'm not saying I did anything wrong, but it's just how redditors are.\n\nI know redditors. They all know each other and are usually good human beings. But this was the first time we had asked redditors if we could ask a female to do an AMA. I thought that this was going to be a big deal. I was right. One woman did an AMA in the last year. I think the other admins (myself included) agreed that the whole situation would be great if the other redditors would volunteer themselves to help. A few more subreddits would be made for \"our\" benefit. It worked. A lot of redditors got interested in the community (and this is reddit, so no matter, the community was just big). So now if a redditor wants to volunteer, she calls us and we get to choose a suitable subreddits for her to do an AMA in.\n\nOne moderator was trying to help me choose reddit and decided to call me and ask what kind of redditor i was. The next I realized they wanted me to choose them (so they wouldn't have to, if they didn't want to, because they could do an AMA anytime). One of the admins was asking me what a redditor was and that it was different if you were an male or female. She then asked me if I considered myself male or female. I told her I was really not sure, that I was unsure about things because I don't have gender assigned pronouns on my birth certificate and the name I use doesn't match my birth certificate either.

{"text": "the evolutionary processes that have enabled bos taurus cattle to survive have persisted until now, despite their large size (Holland et al. 1997); however, it was not always the case, because of a variety of social factors, including genetic constraints and the occurrence of intraspecific competition.\"\n\nDorset's cattle are smaller, and the population densities are lower (Holland et al. 1997), but they have been able to make up their losses by interbreeding. According to Holland (1997), although there is no suggestion that they are interbreeding with anything, a small amount of interbreeding with cattle from east of the Avon is observed from time to time.\n\nAlthough they have remained distinct from bovine populations, these herds have produced hybrids, so it is possible that boviniculture will continue. The cattle were introduced by Thomas the Conqueror in 1086 \u2013 at least they were for a while. Thomas was the King of the Wessex people (originally called the Normans) and in an attempt to consolidate control of Wessex, he and his sons conquered parts of the continent and introduced them into England through his allies in East Anglia.\n\nIt is believed that the introduction was influenced by the British Isles native cattle. Although the cattle's domestication took place during the 437 year English Civil War, the English cattle are an offshoot of the Welsh. In the 4th century a group of people began to make a living with cattle in the British Isles, and around the turn of the 6th century they started to breed them in order to increase their numbers. These people were the Britons, a people who had been in Britain since the earliest of times (at least, as far back as the Bronze Age or as in the Middle Ages). Over time the British developed more domesticated breeds of cattle with better nutritional balances and more space to roam.\n\nIn the 11th century the first cattle were brought to England by the Normans, and they remained here until around 1480. The first Welsh cattle were brought to England in the 15th century by a man, William the Conqueror, and although breeding between their own cattle and those of the Britons continued, from around 1490 the Welsh and their breeders began to breed cattle with cattle elsewhere, and their own cattle became extinct.\n\nThe first records about what happened to the Welsh cattle are in the writings of Edmund Saxon, in his works Cattle and Landed Cattle (ca. 1480), Cattle and Landed Cow (around 1545), and Cattle and Landed Beef (1558). These works describe the Welsh cattle's decline over the centuries as they moved north of the river Taw, and their demise at the hands of the English bull eared cattle imported from continental Europe (also called bullock eared cattle), which replaced the Welsh. The new eared cattle were smaller than the Welsh, less fertile and much more prone to disease (Saxon 2002) The English bull eared cattle eventually replaced the Welsh as the dominant cattle in Wales, causing the English to call the Welsh cattle \"bulls\".\n\nOther European cattle have also been introduced into Britain, but have not replaced the original Welsh cattle in the population. The first European cattle to be introduced to Britain were Holsteins imported from Germany in the 15th century. These cattle had much less of an impact on the British population than the Welsh. In the 17th century a Dutch breed of cow, called the Holstein, escaped to the British Isles from Holland where it had been domesticated as a working animal (Klein 1995).\n\nMore cattle were brought to Britain as cattle from Italy arrived, and in 1801, the East Anglian farmer Joseph Strachan discovered a colony of cattle in a field he was working on about five miles north of Bristol. Strachan began to breed cattle with the cattle of his neighbors, and by the 1920s thousands of small, white bulls, called English bulls by the British, had been produced. This gave rise to the term English bull or British bull\n\nWhen the English bull or British bull breeders began to produce a smaller breed of bull than the original, breeders called this the Irish bull. However, during periods of mass beef consumption or when large quantities of sheep and cattle were slaughtered for food, the large Irish cows and bulls became a liability (Klein 1995). As a result of the slaughter of their cows before they produced enough beef, Irish cattle had low milk production, and many became disease carriers. The Irish bull breeders then increased production of the Irish bull by cross breeding. This made Irish bull cattle a much larger and higher quality animal than the English bull or British bull breeders had been producing. As a result, the Irish bull became the breeding cow of choice throughout the UK. By the 1930s the Irish bull breed had passed to its first purebred offspring who are the famous Highland cattle, the Highland White.\n", "label": 1, "id": 100005}
{"text": "On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Select Committee on Science and Technology, released the results of an investigation into the \"Science\" section of the Department of Energy (DOE) site on Salk's behalf. [3] In his May 2004 statement on Salk's death, Barton wrote that \"a new investigation shows that Dr. Sabin did not die as the result of a contaminated vaccine.\" While citing this source, Barton also criticized the CDC for its \"routine practice of reinterpreting evidence and misrepresenting the facts. This practice has continued for over 13 years. The public is entitled to accurate health and medical history information on any person who dies from a vaccine-related injury, and that does not appear to have occurred on this occasion.\" [3] [1]\n\nBarton's conclusions about the facts of Salk's death were supported by his statement. Dr. Frank Kornfeld of the Office of the Director of Public Health and Environmental Hazards of the CDC was asked by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to describe Salk's death. Kornfeld replied by stating that Salk died \"as a result of a severe allergic reaction\" to polio vaccines, including \"the DTaP vaccine.\" [1] [3]\n\nThe House committee also cited an investigative report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which asserted that Salk was killed by polio vaccine (i.e. he didn't die from a fatal vaccine reaction) and a report of the National Institutes of Health's Office of the Inspector General, which acknowledged that the NIH had \"lost all documentation for administering [Salk's] vaccine.\" The National Institutes of Health had \"lost\" a \"comprehensive medical file for all polio cases. This file was destroyed by the agency without any record being maintained of what did and did not remain relevant.\" [1] [3]\n\nOn 24 March 2006, Dr. Donald R. Thompson of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a sworn statement about Salk's death. [1] He reported that on 23 June 2005, an \"office of the chief health officer\" reviewed Salk's case file to ensure that Salk's medical history was complete. The report concluded that Salk did not die from a vaccine reaction; that \"no information pertaining to a vaccine related reaction was located and no further action was recommended\"; and that Salk's vaccine history was \"in conformity with prevailing evidence in the science literature regarding the safety of DTaP vaccine.\"[1]\n\nIn an 8 January 2007 letter to Congressman Barton, Salk's parents wrote: \"Dr. Thompson's report completely exonerates Dr. Salk of any vaccine-related damage caused by his polio vaccine.\" The letter also included a copy of Dr. Thompson's report, which had been provided by the NIH. [1] [3]\n\nIn 2004, Rambam Medical Center in Israel issued a statement about the death of its father, Dr. Yehuda Rambam. Rambam passed away of a heart attack on 15 December 1991. His death came one day just 15 days after he received Sabin's poliovirus-containing vaccine, the very same vaccine against vaccine-preventable disease that was associated with the death of the Salk siblings in 1955. The parents charged that Rambam's death was caused by a vaccine injury\u2014not a vaccine reaction. Although he may not have been a health professional, Rambam's death also could have been prevented had doctors known about the \"very well documented\" vaccine-caused cardiac arrest and heart attack before administering the vaccination.

Why bother opening a movie if no one is watching it? Especially during a time when theatres are struggling and a movie like this would have been dead on arrival anyway.\n\nTo sum up, when you have two of the most recognizable and beloved fictional characters of all time being made out of a couple of guys who are considered professional wrestlers and a bunch of producers, you do your own thing. The result is a poor effort, at best.\n\n2. The Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nEven today there's still a lot of people who claim the infamous musical, the 1990 Disney \"sad, sad little movie about a girl and the man who saved her, is a masterpiece worthy of our admiration.\n\nHowever, just a very brief look at its Wikipedia article would reveal quite the opposite:\n\nThe Little Mermaid may be the most infamous of all Disney films made to promote a product and to promote Disney to its widest audience.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1991, the \"Mermaid\" became the longest running running number one selling Broadway musical in the world.\n\nThe songs were produced by the Disney subsidiary BGM Entertainment, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nWhile songs were credited to the songwriting teams of two individual writers, there is no proof whatsoever the musical was written by one person and directed by another, with the two people writing most of the songs coming under a single pseudonym.\n\nAccording to the Disney website The Little Mermaid won the Oscar of the best musical for its originality and outstanding achievement, which is actually somewhat misleading since only one \"Original Score\" of the 90 minutes production was nominated. A total of two songs, \"The Little Mermaid\", \"My Fair Lady\", were won for Best Original Song. Since only one of them was nominated though, the actual nominations for Best Original Score went to either The Carpenters or \"All Grown Up\" by the Temptations\n\nAccording to the website The Little Mermaid's theatrical history can be traced back to a few rehearsals and meetings on July 9 and 10 in 1984 with the director Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Michael Greif as musical partners. As for the musical's theme of mermaids, this theme has been used in the past in The Little Mermaid and \"Tangled\" by Hans Zimmer.\n\nIf we look further into how Michael Bubl\u00e9 (of The West Wing and Disney's Aladdin fame) became the director of \"The Little Mermaid\", that is really what the movie is about. As an actor and producer, he has produced many of Disney's highest profile, hit movies, such as Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Cinderella. Bubl\u00e9 and Greif had an idea, and decided to bring the Disney animation to life. In this way the two men ended up with the chance to make what some argue is the greatest musical of all time.\n\nSo who was the director, Michael Bubl\u00e9? Michael Bubl\u00e9 was a relatively unknown Hollywood actor who had little film credits prior to his being cast in this movie, and even less after his being cast in The Little Mermaid. Bubl\u00e9 was born and raised in the United Kingdom and has spent much of his life living and working there.\n\n\"Bubl\u00e9 had been watching BGM Entertainment's productions for some time, and even as an avid fan, he knew he would be perfect in the director's chair. He had produced both BGM and Disney's Aladdin theatrically as well as television productions: he knew exactly what the studio wanted.\" \u2014Michael Bubl\u00e9, director of the Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nAfter starring in the musical The Wiz in 1984, he made a name for himself with the 1990 musical Little Miss Sunshine, which he directed. In 1994, he directed Disney's Aladdin, which was the highest grossing film in the world at that time. The following year, Bubl\u00e9 returned to the Disney fold with Aladdin, which was a modest box office success but failed to live up to its previous successes, and while Aladdin is considered a cult classic by most people, it ultimately failed to win critical praise or critical acclaim when it finally hit theaters.\n\nThe Little Mermaid became his first film to not win an Academy Award nomination, but the film was nominated for", "label": 1, "id": 100007}

One day, she discovered that the radio had been stolen a few days before, and that her childhood friend Yuko Fujikaze (Sayuri Yahagi) was the one who threw it in a river. <br /><br />Yuko tried to escape and the police arrested her, but she refused to confess and claimed that she had never even heard of a radio until she was arrested. <br /><br />The police then set a trap for Yuko and arrested her again. <br /><br />Yuki and Namu continued to search for answers, but found themselves on a different island where they found the ruins of a strange island nation.<br /><br />Koyomi was determined to find out what happened to Yuko, and they both started asking around for the key that would lead them to Yuko, but they were met with many obstacles.<br /><br />\"Do you trust me?\" he asks. <br /><br />Yuno gives Koyomi the key, allowing him to go up to the ruins to look for Yuko. <br /><br />At first Koyomi is reluctant, but eventually he and Yuko have a conversation, with Yuko admitting she found herself on the same island as Koyomi, and that Koyomi seemed to have some sort of ability. <br /><br />The two decide to keep it a secret from the others and they continue to wander the island, passing many people who either look puzzled or suspicious. <br />[caption id=\"attachment_857\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"570\"]<br /></caption> [/caption] [caption id=\"attachment_731\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"570\"]<br />A girl and boy who look a lot alike. <br />[/caption] [caption id=\"attachment_762\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"570\"]<br />The protagonist of my anime, Koyomi. <br />[/caption] [caption id=\"attachment_790\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"570\"]<br />He's really a good guy.[/caption] <dizease=\"centertext\" float=\"center\" >I will never forget my first kiss.</dizease> <dizease=\"text-align:center\" float=\"center\" >The other side of the door.

{"text": "this review summarizes our present knowledge about elderly people's taste and related problems related to their aging. We will introduce the taste and oral function, taste-taste interrelationships, age-related changes in taste acuity, and changes in taste quality in relation with aging, and we will consider the implications of these findings for the improvement of oral health through taste intervention.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough it is commonly accepted as the most reliable way of assessing general health status in humans (Logan and Hirsch, 1989), the ability to accurately judge whether an individual is healthy, is well or suffering from a disease is a subject of much debate (see, for example, van Tongeren et al., 2012). The use of oral tests as a clinical tool is limited in this respect, perhaps due to two reasons: first, there is relatively low sensitivity in these tests, limiting sensitivity and specificity; second, due to the lack of a standardized definition of health, a single test or instrument cannot be used to accurately predict health status.\n\nThe main objective of this review is to introduce the concept of the 'health status' of an individual in terms of both their oral health, and the quality of their oral function. Although the majority of oral tests on 'health status' measures have been developed and tested in other populations, and although the general premise and underlying mechanisms of oral tests for estimating health status have been repeatedly used (e.g. Kallen and Schuster, 1992; Blaser et al., 2007), it is important that the review is informative for the oral health evaluation of the elderly. Previous reviews (e.g. Rabinowitz et al., 1992) have provided useful descriptive summaries of the results from previous studies on health and oral functioning, but our current understanding of the oral health profile of the elderly, as well as the implications of these findings for the evaluation and provision of oral health services to these populations, is primarily based on the results of limited number of population studies. Moreover, because an understanding of the relationship of oral health to overall health status, particularly to the level of the whole body health, is only now emerging, this review is designed not as a comprehensive review dealing with a range of topics related to health. Instead, the main aim of the present review is to highlight our current understanding of differences in oral health among older populations, and these findings are likely to inform the ongoing development and implementation of oral health interventions and programs to improve quality of oral function.\n\nSensitivity of oral examinations to changes in age\n\nSensitivity is defined as the ability of tests to reflect health status accurately at the population level, including differences among different populations. Many previous studies (e.g. Pohlmann and Fuhrer-Lehmann, 1995) have also shown that there will be age-related changes in the response to oral examination, that are not directly attributable to physical health and functional capabilities. These results support the notion that the 'health status' of individuals will change with age. However, it is important to note that it might be possible that these changes, particularly in terms of taste sensitivity, are more likely to reflect changes in the actual health status of the individual. Indeed, several reviews of different countries have noted the possibility of inaccurate estimation of health status due to changes in taste sensitivity in old age (for example, Mather and Gershon, 1994; Kallen et al., 2007, 2014). However, to this date, the extent of this variation in aging has not been systematically evaluated, and future studies are needed to more fully determine whether there is indeed a significant bias resulting from the changing ability of oral examinations to reflect the actual health status of older people.\n\nAge-related changes in taste sensitivity\n\nPrevious findings have shown that there are wide variation in the sensitivity to bitterness (Bakkelian et al., 2010; Wurtman and Sch\u00fctz, 2005) and, importantly, a gradual change in sensitivity with increasing age (Bakkelian et al., 2010). The changes in taste sensitivity observed in older people have been considered due to a variety of different mechanisms, which may include changes in the sensory cells in the tongue (Gollub et al., 1999), modifications in the structure of the tongue (Bakkelian et al., 2010), changes in mucosal permeability (Nestler et al., 2009), or a combination of these. Recently, a study demonstrated that the difference in the sensitivity to bitter taste between subjects (aged 56\u2013100 years) and middle-elderly persons (68\u201379 years) could be explained by different taste cell types in the tongue, and the differences were primarily due to alterations in the subgaleal folds (Kim and Sch\u00fctz, 2012).\n\nRecent publications suggest that ageing may induce some changes in the ability of the tongue to taste bitter compounds.

The total mass fraction in the form of relativistic scalar field, called the \"Lorentz effect\", is also derived and compared to previous results. Our result therefore directly implies the existence of a physical entity which has been previously unknown to science and provides the evidence of a theory that describes the entire matter-antimatter system, from the Big Bang as a mere infinitesimal point in time, all the way up to quarries that form the quantum realm at large distances.\n\n\"The results are extremely satisfying and prove the validity of the approach.

This corresponds to the position-momentum system of the classic quantum harmonic oscillator\u2014in this case, the quantum state with positive energy and zero momentum. In a 3-space-time, the particle's momentum may be negative, but negative velocity (v) is still an invariant state for particles. Since the particle's position-momentum system is linear, the energy E i in this situation is simply (1, 0, 0). In 3-space-time, this corresponds to a system state where (1, 0, 0) has negative energy and (0, 1, 0) has positive energy. (A classical electromagnetic field is equivalent to a point mass in the 3-space-time where E i = -1; in 3-space as seen in the two equations above, the energy corresponds to a system state with negative energy.)\n\n(F) Let us now describe the classical phase space\n\n[5]\n\nand integrate it over the particle's trajectory.

{"text": "the steady current induced by electromagnetic field in a 2d box, due to the gravitational field of the earth, creates a rotation.\n\nIn the \"Tunnel\" section, the \"1s\" signal has started a rotation around a point called the \"center\", causing the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin freely as the gravitational field is not significant enough to cause rotation around such points.\n\nThe \"ZERO's\" signal in the \"Tunnel\" section has caused the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin around the 'center', rotating it into a \"TUNECOIN\" state.\n\n\nThen, the \"0s\" signal from the other direction will cause the 0s signal on the TUNECOIN, causing it to rotate around the 'center' as well.\n\nAt this time, the 0v's will cause the \"TUNECOIN\" state to rotate around the '0v's.\n\n\nThe following pictures show the state of the TUNECOIN when the above 4 pulses have been sent using the above \"ZERO's\" signal.\n\n\nClick on these pictures to compare how it looks as a result of pulses being sent from each (or other) direction, when they were sent.\n\nClick to see further pictures\n\n\nThere are several reasons why it may work that the \"TUNECOIN\" will spin when it is sent from one direction. Some of them may be as an indication of this signal being caused by another pulse not being strong enough to cause rotation of the state.\n\nAs for the \"0s\" signal in the \"Tunnel\" section causing the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin around that same (0v) point, this signal only appears in the \"Tunnel\" section as the state gets closer to the \"2d box\", and a rotation occurs towards the \"0v's\" as it gets closer.\n\nThe \"0v's\" signal and rotation can always be explained by the gravitational field of the earth causing magnetic field changes on the part of the \"TUNECOIN\".\n\nWhen a magnetic field causes magnetic field shifts and magnetic field currents in certain places, their current induced in those places (if there are any) will be due to the shifting magnetic field, and not the earth.\n\nThis magnetic field shifting and current induced in the '0v's' causes the magnetic field inside the 'Tunnel' area to turn due to the current induced in that area.\n\nThe magnetic fields outside of '0v's', will be caused by the earth itself, causing earth currents to be induced on the part of the TUNECOIN which the earth rotates.\n\nThis rotation and magnetic current induced in the 'Tunnel' area is causing the 'Tunnel' area to rotate due to the gravity force.\n\n\nThe 4.21mhz 'Tunnel' section results in a large amount of magnetic field (i.e. 0f) coming from an area which is very far away, causing a magnetic current in the 1s' and '0s' part of the signal to make a strong magnetic field around the center of the box (at 0v) due to the magnetic field in the 1s' and '0s' part being strong enough to make that area move.\n\n\nWhen I sent pulses in these 2mhz boxes, I was quite fortunate in being able to take pictures.\n\nFor these pulses, the \"0v's\" signals were stronger that in the \"Tunnel\" section.\n\nIf the same signal had been used in the \"Tunnel\" section however, the \"ZEROS\" signals would have made the 1s' and '0s' parts of the signal get a strong magnetic field in the '1f' part of the 1s signal.\n\n\nAfter sending 3 pulses on each of these 2mhz channels (with the exact same timing) at the same time of day, the magnetic field inside the box was altered, and the magnetic field outside was altered on the part of the pulse that went out at that time, causing the magnetic field inside the box to turn due to the current in that area, as will be explained below.\n\nIf it is the magnetic field inside the box that causes the magnetic field outside, then (i) the magnetic field within the box can also cause the magnetic field outside of the box which will cause the magnetic fields inside of the '0v's', to turn due to the magnetic field inside of the '0v' causing it to have to be induced as magnetic field shifts, etc. This is what will be explained below.\n\nIf the magnetic field inside the box turns due to the signal on the '0v's, then this will make those magnetic fields outside the box turn due to the signal on the '0v's", "label": 1, "id": 100013}
{"text": "The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, particularly in Japan. A massive solar power plant, the world's first commercial-scale, large-scale, low-energy-intensive photovoltaic system, began operating near Kyoto, Japan, in 2003. The plant can produce 14 megawatts (MW) of electricity, sufficient to power two million homes. While the industry has greatly improved in quality, efficiency, and safety, the market for solar panels remains relatively small. There are many problems with solar energy production, however, including a high upfront cost of purchasing solar panels as well as significant installation fees.\n\nSolar panels have the ability to collect and store sunlight that would otherwise be lost to the power grid when the sun has gone down. This ability provides a natural way to create energy at night, when the sun will not be shining. Solar energy technology has progressed significantly in the past decade. Today, photovoltaic solar panels can deliver more than 5,000 lumens of energy per square meter, and can generate electricity for over 60 hours without having to be connected to the grid.\n\nIn 2013, Japan decided to reduce the amount of energy provided by nuclear energy by five percent. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident occurred in March of 2011. Though it was a tragic event, and nuclear plants in Japan are still operating, it was not directly attributable to the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country.\n\nHowever, in the years that have followed, the nuclear industry has been trying to develop an alternate energy source to provide energy for a future when nuclear reactors may no longer be needed. To this end, and to aid the development of alternative sources of energy generation in Japan, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries began installing solar panels on the rooftops of its factories. The panels, produced by Samsung SDI, were designed to generate about one kilowatt of electricity for every square meter that they were installed.\n\nBy combining a natural source of energy, such as sunlight, with relatively low maintenance costs, the panels are able to increase the energy efficiency of the factories. This gives the factories more energy to use during the day and is a great way to reduce the amount of electricity provided by nuclear plants. The plants also operate in areas that are sometimes dark, such as nighttime, which allows them to use energy that would otherwise be wasted. Combined with the additional utility, the electricity generated by the solar panels is relatively inexpensive to produce and can easily be turned back into electricity when the sun is shining.\n\nThe plants are currently producing a maximum output of about 4 kWh per square meter a night. Though not able to produce enough electricity to completely power every area of the factories' rooftops every day, Japan is considering installing solar panels on the roofs of commercial buildings. This increase in energy production is great help to offset the reduction in nuclear energy production. In the future, Mitsubishi hopes to have commercial solar installations on a large scale throughout the country in order to increase the amount of energy that is produced.\n\nImage credit: Pexels", "label": 1, "id": 100014}
{"text": "we use the concept of doorway states to solve the problem of how to define door-state equivalence. We define a set of door-states to be equivalence classes, say, and define them to be closed under the introduction of a sequence of inputs. This formulation is not the only possible definition: the sequence of inputs that is defined for a particular door-state is the sequence of sequences of inputs that has all of its inputs in this state.\n\nWhat we want is to define equivalence, but we also want to show that if we apply a sequence of inputs, say and, to in the state, then we have in equivalence for the resulting state. Equivalence is not really what we want to do: if we had we would never have found equivalence in our problem. The key to the paper \u2014 and what's neat \u2014 is that the door-state equivalence relation, we use as a tool, is not necessarily an equivalence relation that works in every case. The idea that a specific equivalence relation can be used as a tool to find door-state equivalence is called door-state equivalence induction.\n\nIn the previous section I said that one reason to find out what door-state equivalence is is that the definition we use may not work for all cases. That is, we may discover that we don't need to have any equivalence relation in order to define another equivalence relation. Equivalence is usually defined, in one of these cases, in order to discover where the equivalence relation happens to be defined.\n\nNow the idea of door-state equivalence induction is straightforward. We look at one of the sequence of inputs, say and. We then determine if it is the case that we have with the equivalence relation\n\nsuch that. Then we define the new equivalence relation\n\nand show that we have it. We then define the equivalence relation by\n\nand show that we have for all. Finally, we show that and.\n\nSo basically we start by identifying the sequence of inputs, and, say to see if this is the case. If there is a sequence of inputs, say and, we start with the definition and then look up the sequence of inputs. If we see that there is such a sequence, we know that and form a pair. Thus the definition we give is not really a door-state equivalence; we didn't actually use equivalence as a concept. We start by identifying every equivalence relation on this pair (in our case, since ). We then define in the other direction and show this is still the correct definition. That is, to be invariant, this formula should still hold. And then we define the equality in our target sequence of inputs and show this happens to be the expected result of applying this formula.\n\nThis is the basic idea of door-state equivalence induction. A lot of it is the same as the definition I used above. The big twist is that this time we don't have to know the definitions up front. We just take any equivalence relation, and any sequence of inputs, and define a door-state equivalence relation on them. The door-state equivalence relations thus form a large class of the equivalence relations known to be well defined.\n\nIn general, you could make a lot more use of doors when you look at equivalence relations, but doors have an important unique property about them. They're useful in determining if two sets are the same: if they're both in the same equivalence relation, then they're the same, and if they're not equal, they're not the same.\n\nIf we think of our problem as being to decide that each state in a given sequence of values is valid, doors are a handy tool in that case. In particular, we can look for equivalence relations between sequences of outputs and sequences of inputs all instantaneously.\n\nWe will soon get back to the more general idea of determining equivalence between two sets of objects in our domain, but for now we don't have to worry about that. For one thing, it's useful to think about things that are not sets in the way that we are using this concept to work. If you come from mathematics, you may be familiar with a concept called Cartesian product. In this case, if we start with some number of objects as objects in our domain (say a set ), then we can say that objects in form a Cartesian product\u2014that's to say that there exists a non-empty subset of the set containing all objects. The concept of Cartesian product works in this case because there is a unique set of the form, and every set is, in a sense, a Cartesian product. In this case, we're saying that is a non-empty subset of.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the idea of a Cartesian product, I would advise you to read Introduction to Math to get the lowdown,", "label": 1, "id": 100015}

He had a deep hatred of the Uchiha and had vowed to erase their name from the face of the earth. When the battle finally came, he betrayed the village and led his forces into battle, where he eventually met up with his former comrade and the two fought. To prevent the Uchiha from killing each other, Naruto was forced to kill Kage before he could kill Naruto.[8]\n\nWhile the battle raged on in the forest, Naruto learned of the existence of the Nine-Tails and his father Jiraiya's role in protecting the Sage of Six Paths from it. Jiraiya subsequently departed Konoha along with Sakura, as he believed the Uchiha Clan would never have taken the matter of the Nine-Tails and the Sage of Six Paths with the maturity necessary to do so, and the clan would be at their greatest danger in the fight against the enemy.\n\nNaruto later returned to the battlefield alongside the rest of the Five Kage and the villagers, where they were shocked to witness two teams from Konoha and Sunagakure fight the Nine-Tails together, in what would have been a joint attack if not for the interference of the newly awakened Sasuke Uchiha who came after the Nine-Tails to take it to him and free Tsunade. This gave Naruto the idea to seal the Nine-Tails inside the Tsuchigumo and hide the fact its seal had been breached within the jinchuuriki. He then proceeded to capture the beast along with Tsunade in order to keep them from harming the others and after Tsunade was safely out of the fight, the Ten-Tails was returned to its original seal to prevent others from using it, which also prevented the beast's body from regenerating.[9]\n\nUpon learning of his brother's death, the enraged Naruto started rampaging around the village, resulting in the village being put on lockdown. While the Kage and shinobi of the village were preparing for potential attacks from the enraged animal, a jinchuuriki appeared and proceeded to tear the Tsuchigumo apart. While Orochimaru, Kakuzu, and Hagoromo's teams and Sasuke's team arrived a short time later to help deal with the beast, Sasuke was quickly dispatched by Naruto in a flurry of blows. Sasuke escaped and attacked Orochimaru who had been alerted of the attack, before the beast re-stolen the Tsuchigumo. Naruto and his fellow Kage then sent out teams to search the village for Sasuke while they dealt with the Ten-Tails. Naruto decided to fight Sasuke by himself since Orochimaru and Hagoromo's groups were too strong to face all-at-once. Naruto's attempt to kill Sasuke in this battle failed, resulting in Sasuke having returned to the forest with the Ten-Tails and later attacking the village's villagers. Naruto was able to seal the beast into a giant tree to prevent it from regenerating.\n\nAfter the Ten-Tails was returned to the mountain where the village's main base was located, Naruto and Orochimaru met in person once again after Naruto sealed the Ten-Tails' chakra into it (this caused both the Ten-Tails and Konoha-nin to be trapped inside the Tree of Life due to Naruto not sealing it inside himself first).[10] Orochimaru later taught Naruto various genjutsu techniques in an attempt to use them to take the Ten-Tails and the Tree of Life away from Naruto. Though Naruto initially resisted his teaching, he eventually did so, though in the process learned that no matter how strong he was, he wouldn't be able to kill the Ten-Tails in his current state and would have to leave the Tsuchigumo alone to fight it for him. After learning that the Ten-Tails' power wasn't limited to the Tree of Life, Naruto decided to use the Ten-Tails' chakra to seal the Nine-Tails within himself.\n\nThis did not go according to plan. Using his Sharingan to peer through the Nine-Tails' left eye, Naruto learned that it used both the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the Nine-Tails Demon Seal to seal the Nine-Tails inside Naruto's body and the seal grew outwards. When it reached its full size, Naruto was forced into a life-or-death struggle. The Nine-Tails began sucking the Nine-Tails Demon Seal from him, causing him to lose his memories. When that seal was completely exhausted, Naruto escaped from the Nine-Tails' grip, causing the Nine-Tails to be sealed away as this happened, trapping the beast.

No qualifications.\n\n-When he became unemployed he went to get to the bottom of it all and then went to the house where the shootings occurred and found the people responsible for being there and they had used a lot of drugs and got to that point in their lives where they wanted to do it themselves and then he got caught, that was when he ended up on drugs.\n\n-He said no one at the house had been involved in being in the house and this meant they could have gone and picked up a few and put them somewhere else, but it meant that they had to go into the house, which made them even more serious about what was going on.\"\n\nGavin's sister, Rebecca Williams, 21, of Stoke-on-Trent spoke to the inquest today.\n\nShe told the inquest:\n\n-She was aware that Gavin wanted to become a policeman and that he got to the end of his education when he left school.\n\n-She said the police weren't very good with the kids and that people knew that and that they never had any problems with them but when this incident came about it wasn't anything to do with the police, it was something else.\"\n\nShe said Gavin had been troubled by his past and had made a conscious decision:\n\n-He would not be involved with drugs but instead he was trying to look for a job. She advised he did not need the money for drugs but this was something that made Gavin sad.\"\n\n-She told the inquest she believed some drug dealing had been going on in the area recently. When she contacted police she said she was told Gavin's past was unrelated. When further enquiry was made and Gavin was interviewed it turned out to be the other way round. She added: \"He had made references to drugs that he had started to get involved in at about the time we were speaking.\"\n\nThe jury heard evidence today that Gavin had recently moved out of home with his mother and stepfather. He went to live with his uncle at a house in Chester.\n\nThe inquest continues.", "label": 1, "id": 100017}

But there's been less tension this fall that in the past, as the university has struggled to cope with the fallout from last year's student strike as well as the school's pending expansion.\n\nLast summer, some students wanted the school to drop a proposed football stadium and instead expand on-campus housing. After months of uncertainty, and after multiple attempts by the university to reach out to student organizations about a tentative plan that would have kept students close to campus and to football games, the student government voted to opt out of the proposed expansion, putting off the vote until after the football season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have also been allegations of bias with some of the school's programs, including the department of African-American studies and the school's center for African American studies. But it's not just these efforts around campus that student groups are pushing back on.\n\nStudent leaders who were a part of the coalition seeking greater campus equity are now in control of their student government at Stanford \u2014 and the coalition has been working to move into the executive offices. Stanford's president declined an interview with the News but released this statement in response to the student government's new position:\n\n\"The Stanford University community has made tremendous progress since 2008 when we first launched the efforts to address inequality on our campus,\" said Stanford President John Hennessy.\n\n\"We are the first university in the world to have a Student Wellness Center, and it's thanks in large part to the hard work of student leaders across the campus and a national commitment and grant from President Obama to start the work right away. We also now have a student Senate, a student-run body that includes five student organizations: the Board of Directors, the Board of Advisors, Campus Wellness, the Latino Student Association, and Student Council. That's great progress by everyone. \u2026 But many of the obstacles remain.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the News, student leaders and lawmakers have been putting together a plan to move forward on their campaign to eliminate pay gaps for women and workers without college degrees \u2014 a program they say would benefit the entire Stanford community \u2014 and addressing racism and bias. But the group is facing resistance on both sides as well:\n\n\"The group will likely face significant push-back from alumni and others because it stands in the way of some of the traditional goals of an academic community,\" [University Relations head Andrew] Hamilton said. \"What this does is it creates friction. And as I've tried to explain, the university is at its best when we build bridges on our campus rather than tear them down when we need to learn from one another. This is one small example of an ongoing effort to develop a more inclusive campus that is needed.\n\n\"I've tried to explain to students that we need to create an inclusive campus, one that reflects the diversity of Stanford that does not exclude anyone.\"\n\nIn November, the Stanford Student Government Association (SGA) agreed to meet with student leaders from around the country as part of a multiyear effort to address unequal opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This isn't an initiative unique to Stanford,\" [SGA Executive Secretary and co-founder Nick] Hamer said at the time. \"People across our nation realize it's just not good enough to have one or two programs, or even a handful. No one has the resources to address every inequity that comes up, so we can do better.\"\n\nThis is certainly not to say that these groups are uninterested in these efforts. The new members that will take over positions in the SGA are some of the students who led in the effort to create a student-run housing system. The group also continues to push for a student-controlled Senate, and a focus on race and gender in its meetings.\n\nBut this movement may face some additional complications along the way as more student leaders come onboard, given the pressure they'll now see to be responsive to these more prominent groups.", "label": 1, "id": 100019}

{"text": "1983's \"\"Frightmare\"\" is an odd little film. The director seems to be saying, \"My only mistake. I've made a bad film. But it will help me grow.\" What he could have said was, \"Well, it all worked out alright. The film will help bring me closer so that we'll work together better in the future.\" But that wouldn't seem much better. So the film doesn't have a strong message, but that doesn't matter. The film is a cult classic for what it was and is. And \"Frightmare\" is a classic horror film for what it is.\n\nWhat makes \"Frightmare\" such a \"classic\" is mostly the fact that it was directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, a \"cult classic\" for everything from his music to his vision (and his personal, twisted interpretation of things), and for every aspect of, well, everything, including that it stars Antonio Banderas as a cannibalistic vampire god. So it's hard at times to define \"classic\" and it's hard at times to define a horror film, especially one from the 1980s. \"If\" horror should be based around horror films that are \"classic,\" then by definition, most horror films, \"Classic Horror\" films, \"can't\" be \"classic.\" It's a pretty common misconception and one that continues to frustrate aspiring filmmakers in their attempts to make \"great\" horror films.\n\n\"Frightmare,\" despite its genre-shifting, disturbing and deeply-laced themes, is considered by many to be a very disturbing horror film, and there is a reason for this. Jodorowsky has written and directed some truly horrific films in his career, including \"The Great Dictator,\" \"El Topo,\" \"The Holy Mountain\" and that aforementioned \"Frightmare.\" So much so that the film is still regarded as an extremely disturbing and disturbing film. If you've ever watched it, you'll know why that is a very disturbing film.\n\nThe film's theme is actually fairly simple, but it is extremely effective. In the film, humans are being devoured by the very thing they are fighting against. In \"Frightmare\" humans are pitted against the creatures they have feared and feared: vampires. The vampires are intelligent, monstrous and have taken human form of human. By turning people into vampires, and turning humans into vampires, the vampires essentially have defeated them \u2014 so the humans are stuck as the mere husks they were to begin with. The film ends with the main character's friends and family watching him being carried off in a truck.\n\nSo \"Frightmare\" is a classic horror film in that it's a horror film. But it's also \"classic\" because of Jodorowsky's own use of horror as a metaphor in the film. As a film director, Jodorowsky is probably the most influential and the most effective \"Horror\" director in the 70's and 80's (yes, even better than Guillermo del Toro or the great Sam Raimi), including horror's development as an aesthetic/philosophy. \"Frightmare\" is a great example of this. The film doesn't have any particularly scary monsters, but by the end of the film, you can't help but be very scared because you've known that vampires are terrifying. It's so important for a filmmaker to do this.\n\nSo instead of taking advantage of classic horror stereotypes like monsters, monsters in the 1980's are more likely to be the \"monster\" of the piece, rather than the more conventional and more interesting monsters. And when filmmakers use classic horror clich\u00e9s like ghosts or vampires, they are basically telling a very familiar and formulaic story, one that you've seen countless times. So you don't get to see anything new or innovative. That's how we see so many old films being made today, and the great \"Spooky Night of the Living Dead\" is a prime example. It actually takes the idea of a ghost or vampire a little deeper than how you would expect. There are no zombies, or even a human ghost here, and that's a really great choice on their part for \"Spooky Night of the Living Dead.\" They were using classic horror tropes exactly as they were intended \u2014 the idea of making a human human-shaped ghost.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Jodorowsky was responsible for the rise of \"Horror\" as an art form. So if you're thinking that you want to make a horror movie, and you want to make a film that scares you, then you should definitely consider reading his \"Art of Fear\" when it comes out this Autumn. I know we've been talking a lot about Alejandro Jodorowsky and \"Frightmare\" recently, but we actually want to talk about \"Tron Legacy\" more, so let's get to that.\n\nAfter completing \"Tron,\" which was a very personal and interesting film for both I", "label": 1, "id": 100022}

{"text": "When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I knew I had to share it \u2013 but I had no idea it was something special, and I did not believe it would turn into such a cult classic as it has (and is still to this day). I really felt bad because people were so dismissive of it, and I was so sure about my review, but you are the people to believe in me and let me know if I am wrong, so I was willing to put myself out there and be judged by the people who would really be able to pick apart the film based on my thoughts. So here it is, the definitive review of The Manchurian Candidate.\n\nIf it sounds like I really didn't like this film, I don't blame you. I really did not like it at all, and I'm sure it's because I was too skeptical about such a film after reading the first time, but I am really glad I finally watched it, because since then there have been other people who have made me want to spend even more time re-watching it, but the fact is that the new reviews I've seen on IMDb \u2013 like mine \u2013 are all saying really great things about the film, which just proves that it is one of those films that is truly unique. As I said when I first watched the film, it feels like Michael Haneke's The Squid and the Whale made to look as if it were shot with some of the same effects and music Haneke directed for the TV miniseries, and that's exactly what makes it even better, and makes it even more horrifying when you think about it. So while I'd normally say what did good, what made it good, I'm actually going to cover what I think the flaws were, and then say if I thought about it, well, maybe a few things here and there don't make a lot of sense or don't really give a lot of insight into the film, but I still feel like it's an excellent, terrifying, and chilling film that deserves its place on the world's greatest horror cinema list, because I know if it was the other way around, I could almost understand if people didn't want to sit and watch it, and I can honestly say I still don't, and I will never stop trying to see the film again and try to see it one more time. In fact, that's why I'm writing this blog right now. If you know anyone who enjoys, likes, or even just enjoys good films (or horror films, for that matter, because every movie needs to be able to stand on the top 100) you can't really fail them if you haven't seen The Manchurian Candidate, and even if you have, the more you know, the more you'll be able to pick out how it can scare, frighten, and delight you, because that's exactly what you think of from the film and what made it such a great, terrifying, and chilling film. That's why I'd dare say, if I were asked to rank the best, I think this would probably just be in the top 10 lists \u2013 because it's just so damn good!\n\nThe film is all about a man named David Clines (played by an absolutely insane Paul Newman), who is a doctor specializing in dealing with mental illness, which is his specialty (he is a psychiatrist, and it's one of the films defining aspects \u2013 one of the main villains, who happens to be mentally unstable himself, calls it the \"specialist in madness\"). He meets a young girl from a wealthy family named Helen, who is in an insane asylum (as everyone has to be in order to be taken there \u2013 this is the \"hospital\") and begins a serious affair with her (there is literally nothing in the film so insane that I haven't seen before) and when one of Clines' patients is brutally murdered, he goes on a rampage, which ends up causing serious consequences for him and, ultimately, for them both. The film goes into several, and I have to say some pretty wild, turns as it goes, and there's a few times where it goes so, so in the other direction I thought that it was a little disorienting that it was, despite all that is going on, a very traditional, thriller-type, psychological thriller with a little bit of horror thrown in (it takes place in the 70's before the era of the giallo, but still features supernatural and sexual overtones in the way that the gialli often do \u2013 and Clines is a very sexual character, so this is something that I don't think many people would have thought much about at the time, but it's all just a way of showing that the film doesn't really take itself very seriously).\n\nWhat you also want to know about the giallo is that they like to kill people off in the first third of the film, and the first half of", "label": 1, "id": 100025}
{"text": "background : there is increasing interest in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) as a leading cause of cancer mortality and a significant burden on health systems. However, the relationship and etiology of the various populations is poorly understood. Since the hepatocellular carcinoma has been linked to the development of different cancers, we investigated the correlation between the incidence of HCC and plasma levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated whether the plasma levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 are related to the risk of different cancers in populations with different risk factors. We evaluated whether different concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 correlate with the risk of different cancers, by using data for the United States and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II.\n\nWe also sought to examine whether the associations between IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and the risk of different cancers vary by histologic subtype. Two previous studies have investigated the association of IGF-I with different subtypes of liver cancer ( 4 \u2013 6 ). However, they found little evidence of dose-dependent increases in risk. Furthermore, in a recent study of breast cancer risk, high levels of IGFBP-1 (which are thought to mediate the insulin-like effect of IGF-I) were only associated with ductal adenocarcinomas, not with follicular, mesothelioma, nor squamous cell carcinomas of the breast ( ).\n\nThe role of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in cancer progression is of increasing interest. Evidence from animal studies suggests that IGF-I can play a role in carcinogenesis in vivo and that higher insulin-like growth factor-I levels are associated with increased risk of certain types of cancers in humans. For example, mice bearing a human growth hormone receptor (GHRI) expression cassette show increased tumor growth and carcinogenesis due to their high basal growth rate and high expression of the receptor in tumors, suggesting that GH stimulates IGF-I secretion ( 1 \u2013 4 ). Similarly, high basal IGF-I levels are observed in human colon and prostate cancer tissues and in normal tissue from patients with carcinoma of the colon or prostate ( 5, 6 ).\n\nA 2 (age) \u00d7 2 (sex) by 2 (cancer) \u00d7 3 (country of birth) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons was performed to assess significant differences in associations between plasma IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with cancer risk. Differences were considered significant when P <.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nWe examined associations between serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 and HCC incidence in various populations with different risk factors and histologic subtypes ( ) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES III). NHANES III was a representative cross-sectional survey that is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of CDC.\n\nUsing stratified analyses adjusted for ethnicity (non-Hispanic black or Mexican-American; non-Hispanic white or other; non-Hispanic other or some other race), age, and sex, we adjusted for all confounders in order to minimize the effects of confounding variables and stratify for race/ethnicity. A priori, we conducted analyses stratified by sex and sex stratified by age in order to examine whether the effects of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 differed between males and females. As a measure of relative risk of HCC, we also stratified by age stratified on sex and divided IGF-I and IGFBP-3 by age or, in NHANES III subjects with a follow-up time short enough to be less than 5 y, by the follow-up interval (ie, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or longer), which did not confine the analysis to the oldest participants. With regard to cancer histologic subtype, we examined the risk of different histologic sub-types of HCC. We also examined associations between circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and risk of various cancers.\n\nIn multivariate analyses with stratified data on sex, age, and race, in which the variables used to define cohorts (CY) could be categorized as following: age < 35 y; age 35\u201349 y; age 50\u201359 y; age \u2265 60 y; race/ethnicity < non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American; non-Hispanic white; Mexican-American; non-Hispanic some other race;some other race; some other race or non-Hispanic other (non-Hispanic other or some other race); age \u2264 25 y; age \u2265 25 y; sex <", "label": 1, "id": 100026}
{"text": "we investigate experimental consequences of the postulate that fundamentally photon-based quantum devices would be impossible to construct at all,\" the researchers explained in their paper.\n\n\"We propose the possibility of using the principles of thermally induced quantum error correction on an atom-scale device\u2014a proof that the thermodynamic system is sufficiently compatible with quantum interference. If our model is correct, it would represent fundamental quantum supremacy in which quantum errors are corrected via photon\u2013photon interactions.\"\n\nThe research team's proposed experiment involved heating a beam of photons to an extremely hot point, so high that the light no longer behaved as a stream of particles. The beam was then used to cool and concentrate the photons, causing them to behave as a single quantum system. The hot beam then flowed into a small chamber within which an array of two-bit gates was placed. This array consisted of two gates and two photons, which were \"caught\" in an interlaced wave pattern of entangled states. The team then measured the differences between the two photon states based upon its interference pattern and found that, because the photons were coherently coupled, they could each exhibit two different atomic behaviors.\n\n\"The key insights we gained were that the difference in quantum states could be completely encoded in one photon, and that the two states could be measured simultaneously and unambiguously,\" Jha said.\n\n\"That gives us the possibility of measuring the two states together with the single one.\"\n\nWhile the experiment only simulated one quantum behavior, the researchers believe that it could be used in real life to test whether entanglement could be maintained at a single atomic level.\n\n\"If entanglement did not exist, we might never be able to test the second-generation Bell inequality,\" Jha said. \"But the reason it exists is that quantum fluctuations can be generated, as we have shown, in a very simple setting by a single photon. If we can make our approach scalable to higher atomic levels of control, we could prove that the second-generation Bell inequality is wrong and that entanglement still exists, something which would be impossible to prove under any other assumptions.\"\n\nThe Stanford researchers also suggested that their experiment could serve as a proof-of-concept of their proposed methodology for quantum error correction. By cooling the device, or by directly pumping out and then cooling the device\u2014a process that could be done easily in a laboratory\u2014the researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed experiment. After cooling the device, they found that the device did not act as \"a kind of waveguide that creates entanglement,\" but rather as a way to focus and concentrate the beam of photons, effectively reducing entanglement and resulting in a reduction of errors.\n\n\"If you cool it down, you get a much more coherent and localized system,\" Zagorodnyi said.\n\n\"The reason is that the photons are concentrated in a small zone and that density has a physical effect. We now imagine that the energy density is what causes the error. This idea holds great promise for quantum information processing that is based just on photons.\"\n\nExplore further: Theories of quantum physics explain why 'quantum coherence' isn't real\n\nMore information: \"Quantum error correction via cold lasers via coherence and entanglement,\" Science, science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi \u2026 1126/science.aac8846", "label": 1, "id": 100027}

In any event, on March 4th, he did not get his $50 million even when he actually lost\u2014which happened on the night of the March 12th show, when he was given three additional decisions.\n\nIn fact, Tyson said the following in an interview this week with The Wall Street Journal:\n\n\"When we do this interview... I don't even know if I'll be in the ring when he talks to those judges. I'm not even sure what I'd say.\"\n\nIn other words, Tyson just doesn't believe that the fight should have counted given that it was a trilogy fight where one man, once a former champion, was given three more decisions.\n\nIt was a big \"no-go.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN's Andy Katz, HBO has never apologized to Tyson for the show, despite the fact that the company had no control over what happened on the night. Furthermore, according to the ESPN investigation, \"HBO executives were deeply disappointed by the decision, telling them not only that the fight should not count, but that they would not be able to find a judge who felt like it did when they sent the first draft of the fight off to the judges.\"\n\nA fight that was supposed to sell for $50 million would not have sold.\n\nSo, now, what is it about this case that makes people care so much about what Tyson has to say, and not only about what he says?\n\nAs I wrote on March 4th, part of the reason that this case is so compelling is because it has so many players involved; all those who, prior to that night, made a number out of $1 million or more from the outcome of this fight, from people who were involved in this entire fight, with Showtime, from HBO, from judges, all the way down to the ringside security staff. They can bring a lot of money into play, and people do care about them.\n\nPeople, too, can get rich from the UFC. The first pay-per-view event of the UFC has topped the record of $400 million in revenue.\n\nAnd the UFC made $731 million from the first three PPV events of 2013, which are all on FOX.\n\nSo, is it just because he won? Is it just because he wasn't knocked out? Is it just because the judges thought he won by decision? Is it because, if that's all it was, it would all be easy to fix? It would have been so easy to fix, and the first problem would be the UFC has to pay all its employees. It has to pay all the judges. It has to pay the fighters. It has to pay for everything else.\n\nAnd that's on top of everything else.\n\nSo people want to win, because the UFC pays these people to win, and it keeps the UFC in business, and the UFC is worth something. So why do people want them to win, when the reason they want the promotion to succeed is because it makes them money?\n\nPeople want to watch them compete, because they are worth watching, and they do bring in a lot of money. So why do they want them to win, when the reason they want them to win is because they'll make them money?\n\nSo, is money really the only thing that matters? Is", "label": 1, "id": 100028}

{"text": "Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"\"McCabe\"\" could be a possible candidate.\n\nThis movie was initially directed and written by Cary Grant (from his script for \"\"The Big Sleep\"\"\" - see below) and stars Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Richard Burton and Charles Browning. It was released in 1956 by Paramount, and in 1959 by the MGM studio. The original novel by L.P. Hartley (a sequel to the earlier film \"The Big Sleep\") was written by John Galt, and is set in the \"Seed of the South\" in the \"Wild West\". The main character is a young \"West Texas Ranger\", who leaves his frontier home to protect the women and girls in a town of the West. In addition to an emphasis on frontier life, the novel features an interesting moral: \"A man's responsibility is not to God, but to his kind.\"\n\nThe film was a major commercial and critical success, and won the \"Grand Prix\", the \"Best Director\" award, and numerous Academy Award nominations. Its success was due to its combination of action, western humor, and moralist themes. In 1959, it featured in a number of \"Best Westerns\" polls, but despite winning several awards - one of them, the Best Director award - the film didn't win. Many believe that its performance in the category of \"Best Westerns\" is largely due to this fact.\n\n\"McCabe\" is also the name of a John Wayne story, first published in 1925, and one of the best-known westerns, even though it has been somewhat overshadowed by his more popular \"Gone With the Wind (in some critics eyes at least)\". \"McCabe\" also features an excellent and powerful supporting performance from Ray Milland. It was first produced for the MGM network as a feature film, but didn't catch on. When it was re-done, it was released by the MGM studio in 1952. It was a commercial success, and was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award nomination at the 55th annual Academy Awards. It was originally directed by Joseph H. Lewis (from a story by Roy Ward Baker) and stars Wayne in more than one role.\n\n\n\"The Big Sleep\" (1959) by William Randolph Hearst\n\n\"The Big Sleep\" is the first novel from legendary author William Randolph Hearst. Originally titled \"Big Sleep\", it was published in April 1954, by Scribner's, a division of the famous Doubleday publishing group. In this novel, Hearst depicts \"a small and troubled Western town\" in Texas, as an isolated young girl goes with her father to a cabin on the outskirts of town. This girl's father, a lawman named John Naylor (played by Jack Kilmer), is killed during a raid on a gang of bandits, and she becomes the \"new sheriff\" of the town. At first, she struggles to carry out her duties, but by this time the town is so isolated that the residents have built an imaginary world to themselves. They believe that all of what happens is in their minds, and a visitor from the outside world may disturb the peace of their town, or worse, kill them.\n\nThe story tells mainly of the life of a man - J. D. 'Doc' Holliday - a veteran lawman who is on the road to recovery from a serious injury he suffered on a horse-back raid against a band of Native Americans. He visits the town, but has little trouble finding his way. Things develop quite differently when a mysterious woman (played by Joan Crawford, who would be nominated for a Oscar for \"Hustle and Flow\") enters their lives, and they begin to share their thoughts about how to best protect their town. While the film was released in the United States by United Artists, it was distributed by Hearst, who felt that it deserved the prestige of a movie of its stature. There is also controversy as to whether the film was a genuine western, or a fake retelling from a stage play. (See \"\"The Kid Who Wasn't There\"'s trivia page for more details)\n\nThis film was actually released in the United States by Paramount (a subsidiary of Viacom) in 1959, but it was produced by United Artists after the success of \"\"The Big Sleep\". The screenplay was written by William A. Dietz, and starred Charles Laughton, who wouldn't win a better movie Oscar in his career (and has also died in a motorcycle accident before this film). Charles Laughton won an Oscar for this best supporting performance in a supporting role for his performance in \"\"The Sting\"\" (see below). The original Broadway production of \"\"The Big Sleep\"\" was directed by Robert Altman, and it featured an incredible cast including Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.\n\nIt has also been reported that the producers of this film felt that they couldn't get it made without John Wayne", "label": 1, "id": 100033}
{"text": "superdeformed states in light @xmath0 nuclei are studied by means of an interferometer. In the same way that light waves are deflected by the surface of a mirror, nuclei on this surface may be deflected by the same interferometer. As long as the interferometer is kept at the right distance, no matter which nuclei are affected the same will happen to the image. The interference pattern between the nuclei and the light waves has been studied experimentally. The results of these experiments are given as follows:. When a nucleus is in the interferometer, the interaction between nuclei and the light waves tends to spread the light wave all over its angular direction. If a nucleus is in the interferometer, this means that the interaction tends to push the light waves towards the nucleus. From a mathematical point of view, the interaction between a nucleus and a light wave is called the local interaction. The two examples shown in the figure above show how the interaction between two single nuclei can influence the light waves and produce a changing image. Thus, a nucleus may act like an electronic \"screen\" and produce a uniform field on all directions with a slight bias of the fields. The fields can be described by the Lorentz transformation function of the interferometer. For example, the magnetic field of the nucleus A is written in terms of Lorentz, where A is an arbitrary magnetic nucleus in a certain state according to the theory. The local interaction (interference pattern) which is formed between a pair of nuclei is given by: and the energy levels of the wave functions are given by the following formula. So far, we found both the interaction and the energy levels. However, it is important to realise that the interaction does not mean that some forces are acting only in one direction but that all the forces can be described also in terms of the three terms: the local interaction, the field dependence and the Lorentz transformation. In terms of the Lorentz transformation function, we may also write the two terms: The results of this analysis are given by the following equations for the field dependence: Now, the energy levels are given as follows: and,, the field dependent on the state of the local interaction, the first term in the Lorentz transformation function, and the second term from the Lorentz transformation function. Note that the interaction between the two nuclei only influences the image in the one direction and that the field dependent functions is related to the local interaction between two nuclei. The figure shows that the interferometer produced an image with a bright spot due to the local interaction and an area of relatively small brightness in the other direction, due to the field dependent interaction. This is because the interaction (which we call \"weak\") between nuclei and the radiation field changes only the wave field of the light wave. This change of the wave field is called the \"weak field dependence\". And for this reason a strong interaction between nuclei is required for the weak interaction to be preserved. If there exists a strong interaction between the nuclei, you can see that the image is not produced. The interaction is called \"strong\" only if the two nuclei have the same spin state, and as we know, for two particles with the same spin, the angular momentum of the particle with higher spin is always greater than the angular momentum of the particle with lower spin, therefore a change in that angular momentum does not impact the state of the particle with higher spin. So if an image of a particle is produced by observing a particle with an enhanced spin state which is located on the nucleus, you can observe two different spots on the image. The first spot is due to the interaction between the particle with higher spin and the radiated radiation on that particle. This interaction may bring a \"tipping\" of the particle with higher spin. The state of the particle with higher spin can be seen as a local interaction and can be used for explaining the interaction between two particles or the interferometer and its results. The state of the particle with lower spin will have no effect on the state of the particle with higher spin, so no \"tipping\" will come from this interaction. For this reason, the state of that particle with lower spin will be not produce visible spot on the interferometer's image due to the weak interaction between the two particles.

{"text": "archetypal analysis represents each individual member of a set of groups by the average of the means of the groups. So the average of the mean between A and B is a measure of the distance between the populations of A and B. In the study of European populations this distance is known as the k-th distance (the k here is a common, and rather arbitrary, designation). This distance can be understood as a measure of the genetic distance between two populations.\n\nTo the extent that there is genetic distance between two populations then they are genetically distinct (though there might not be very much genetic difference, or a good deal of gene flow, between them). This is the basis for the term \"population structure\". To the extent that the means of a group are the same from one generation to the next then they are genetically homogenous (although some groups show some amount of genetic drift). This is known as assortative mating (which in this context is taken to imply some amount of genetic differences between groups). But whatever the genetic nature of a set of populations then there are genetic relationships among them, and these can be measured.\n\nThe population structure of an entire European population is known as genetic continuity or genetic identity. It is this which is the topic of debate. Although the genetic continuity of the entire European population should be approximately the same as that of any single European, in practice the genetic continuity of all groups within an entire population is not the same. Many individuals in one population might be from a separate group, or even more than one group, while a number of individuals in another population might belong to the same group as those in the previous population. This means that the genetic continuity of a population can sometimes be as much a matter of local geography as of the average genetics within the population.\n\nTwo populations, each with two parents, two siblings, and two grandparents, form a population with two common grandparents. So the genetic continuity of the two populations must also be four (two shared grandparents plus two common grandparents). This is known as the nth degree of linkage, or n-th degree of linkage, (n- for a normal symbol, which is n + 1). (All links will be given the symbol n- for convenience, although this number is sometimes abbreviated as n, and also commonly known as linkage number.)\n\nWhat is the probability of two populations with just two grandparents, two parents, two siblings, and two grandparents coming from the same genetic background, and thus sharing a common heritage? The probability is just 1 in 4, or 1/4.\n\nIn fact that might not be very encouraging for a geneticist hoping to identify populations that do have common genetic inheritance. Since the average genetic distance between the two populations is only about 2/3 there is a decent chance that all the populations will have two common parents, two common siblings, and two common grandparents. Yet this probability is much larger than the chances of all of the populations being from the same parent population. In other words, there is only a 4/3 probability that two generations of two populations will share the same genetic background.\n\nOf course, we can have a bit more fun with this number. What if we had no more than two mothers, two fathers, two brothers, and so on (so six generations)? If we had eight generations, and the average distance between any two members of one generation was 2/3, then the genetic continuity of all pairs of population pairs would be 2/3, or 4/3. But given that each pair has six generations, this might not be such a bad bargain.\n\nNow let us consider another case: three or four grandparents (so fifteen generations). This yields a probability of 2/3 that any pair of descendant pairs will share the same genetic background, making the common genetic heritage of all pairs of descendants pairs 3/3. But of the two pairs with three or four grandparents, there has got to be one that will carry the common genetic heritage of all the remaining members, so that the common genetic foundation is at least 8/2 (3 plus 3 plus3, or 8). So the probability that all of the descendants will have exactly the same genetic background per generation, not given above, is 2/2, or 3/2.\n\nTwo things are clear from the figures. Even though each generation has a probability of only 1/4 that it will be from the same parent population, there is a 1/2 chance that all descendants will have identical genetic backgrounds (assuming that they are all cousins) over the course of the two generations they encounter. It looks as if there is no genetic continuity between any Europeans. There is no \"shared genetic heritage\". Instead, there is a shared linguistic ancestry.\n\n\nThe question is whether this linguistic heritage is a strong enough connection to warrant calling the entire European population a single, genetically identifiable whole. The answer is yes! The historical question \"what languages are spoken in Europe?\" was formulated by two 19th-century philosophers", "label": 1, "id": 100037}

{"text": "in the United States, though, it is not clear if the government will provide its full information or even whether government lawyers will have the information to fight it.\n\nThe federal government's argument is that the plaintiffs did not have an opportunity to provide an equal opportunity to respond to the government's notice of claim. It argues that it did not have information from the plaintiff, even with its full request, even because it says it did not respond to the notice at risk deadline. Moreover, it says, if the plaintiffs had made the request, government lawyers would have been required to disclose the plaintiff's identity. The government has not indicated how it will respond to the plaintiffs' request for the plaintiff's identity.\n\nLast April, the Supreme Court allowed an employee in a California Department of Water Resources (DWR) contract dispute to withdraw her claim, saying that even if she did not respond to the notice at risk deadline and the DWR had a full answer to her complaint, it was required by law to identify her. That case was brought by a former DWR employee alleging discrimination based on religion, which violates the federal Civil Rights Act, and which the DWR was required to investigate. Although in that case the plaintiff could have removed her complaint for insufficient information, the court said that did not take the government's refusal to respond to the notice at risk deadline into account. \"The Government has stated that it responded to the notice at risk request for reasons of its own,\" it said. \"The Supreme Court noted: When a private party asserts a right of its own, it does not thereby waive its right to pursue the other party to compel it to provide that right. A party whose request is denied because of lack of information is not deemed to waive the right to obtain that information.\" The government should also release the information, at some point, because the plaintiffs are not the only ones that will see the information.\n\nIn 2014, then-U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr argued in federal court in Utah, that the Justice Department has a duty to name witnesses in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, as well. \"Plaintiffs have not claimed that Defendants waived any statutory or constitutional privilege in releasing the requested information,\" he wrote, but \"Defendants will now have to respond to the plaintiffs' discovery requests and provide sufficient details relating to the circumstances in which and the reason for Defendants' initial refusal to provide information.\"\n\nAs a part of a FOIA lawsuit, the plaintiffs will most likely ask for a subpoena to compel the government to release the name of the contractor, a contract, and the identity of the person responsible for the complaint. But it would be good to hear at this point the government's legal rationale for why it is now refusing to provide the names. In the last few years it has been pretty clear that the government does not enjoy privacy and is not required to protect the identities of its contractors or employees.

{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery said on Wednesday they would go to trial over accusations they refused to sell a wedding cake to a lesbian couple in 2012, only to learn they had been slapped with a $135,000 fine by the state agency that oversees business licenses.\n\nSame-sex weddings are legal in Oregon and Washington state, but not in Utah or Georgia.\n\n\"We're in court and we're doing our best to have a defense,\" said the owners' attorney David Cortman.\n\nTiffany and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were thrilled when they found out in March 2013 that Portland bakery Sweet Cakes by Melissa would be denying them a $135,000 wedding cake in 2012 because they were gay.\n\nAs part of its effort to force the owners to sell, a state licensing board slapped the business with a $135,000 fine, accusing it of telling a customer in a letter not to order their cake - because they were gay.\n\nThe lesbian couple's attorneys argued that they were defrauded by the business and that in the end they paid more for their original cake than the $100,000 fine was worth.\n\n\"They gave them a cake. They never ordered a cake,\" Cortman told Reuters. \"They made a decision not to buy a cake.\"\n\nWhen the bakery owners learned of the fine, they contacted police to turn over a statement they had given to the state licensing board saying they would not sell to anyone because of a wedding-related reason and were told by an attorney that it would be impossible to collect it.\n\nBut the licensing board had never asked for the statement, and the letter was never reviewed, the Bowman-Cryers contended.\n\nThe state, which originally filed the claim against the bakery in 2011, has a $40,000-a-day deadline to pay or it could file an appeal, said Jack Thompson, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Justice.\n\nThe state was due to begin depositions in the case this fall but would now start in September, he said.\n\nCortman said he expected a hearing after the court case, possibly for a few weeks, adding that he was looking forward to cross-examining witnesses like the bakery's former human resources manager.\n\nThe bakers could get the money out of the penalty in three installments, Cortman said, to avoid the burden of going to trial.\n\nWhile most people are accustomed to buying cakes that are a few dollars, the Bowman-Cryers' cake cost $105,000, said Matthew Patisnook, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Northern California.\n\nIf the state were to prevail at trial, the bakers could collect about $60,000, Patisnook said.\n\nAn attorney for the bakers could not be reached for comment.", "label": 1, "id": 100047}

{"text": "class  i methanol masers are believed to be produced only after the reaction is completed (Sang et al. 2011). The temperature of methanol molarity depends on the pH value (Sang et al. 2011; Deutscher et al. 2011). To explain the formation rate, heat produced from reactions above the range of pH will be needed to melt the surface of the polymer, which is produced in a relatively low temperature. The concentration of methane is very low in the air because of decomposition of organic matter, making the generation of methanol easier. At least one report indicates that at least 10\u201310 times more methane is generated by the reaction of methanol at 200 \u00b0C compared to the reaction at normal temperature (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data; Deutscher 2005, Sang et al. 2011). The heat production depends strongly on the pH value. At low pH values of 5.7\u20135.8, methanol melts at 725 \u00b0C under normal temperature conditions, but at pH 5.8 the reaction proceeds at 700 \u00b0C only (Sang et al. 2011). At a pH of 5.8\u20135.10, the resulting mixture will be composed of methanol and methanol (2:2), a mixture known as 1:1, which can withstand the reaction of methanol at 700 \u00b0C for almost one hour. At higher pH values it is possible to extend the time from 12 to 24 hours (Sang et al. 2011). In this regard, the temperature of reactions at lower pH values should be higher (Sang et al. 2011).\n\nThe chemical reaction of methanol is characterized by the formation of methanol and methanol 2:1 because of the difference in the number of carbons of the side chain of the 2-oxo-hydroxybenzene ring. In other words, it can be seen that the acid group at the head of the ester bonds of methanol is more acid than the acid at the tail. The resulting gas will be converted back to methanol by the hydroxylation of the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the gas mixture containing the methanol will be more acidic than it was before the reaction on its surface. Consequently, the gas mixture with methanol (1:1) will be oxidized by a sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) reaction (Larsen et al. 1995), producing water and carbon dioxide (see Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of a sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) reaction. The oxygen is given by the carbon atoms, which are not present in the solution (green) when the SO 2 is oxidized to the sulfuric acid by water molecules. (1) The sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) is given off.\n\nThe concentration of methanol at the surface is strongly dependent on the pH value. When the pH is lower (5.6\u20135.8), about 80\u201390% of the gas mixture is water (W\u00e4stner and Blomberg 2010). The methanol (1:1) generated has a low mass concentration and the gas mix contains small amounts of carbon dioxide, the major component of the gas with methanol. Above a pH of 6.5 the gases are mixed even more, with around 80% water with a lower concentration of methanol. The water with low mass concentration (3:4) is of low concentrations (0.02%) and contains mostly water, carbon dioxide, and sulfuric acid (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data).\n\nIt is possible to explain the generation of methanol by the hydrolysis of a water-containing solution of 2C-H with oxygen. The reaction will proceed due to the action of the oxygenated alcohol. However, in our experiment (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data) hydrogen is not reduced during the oxidation. Instead, the reactants of the reaction must be removed from the system to prevent the formation of methane. However, hydrogen is not removed from the system, since it has a higher temperature than the oxygen in the sample. Consequently, it may be that at low temperatures and low pressure the hydrogen is converted to water. The hydrolysis of the alcohol creates two products; methanol, a simple alcohol that will be converted to methanol 2:1 and water. The CO 2 formed is not as important in the generation of 2H-cis ethylene as in the case of hydrogen. This is due to the greater heat release (12\u201324 hours) on the reaction at low pressure.\n\nAlthough both H 2 O and", "label": 1, "id": 100049}

{"text": "human and mouse skin accumulate senescent cells in both the skin and in many organs. The number of senescent cells increases as more senescent cells accumulate. Senescent cell-like cells accumulate and become clumps of cellular debris. These clumps then accumulate in the skin and in many liver, heart, and lung tissue types. In humans, the number of senescent cells can be an indication of age-related disease because they occur in most tissues and often form the majority of senescent cells in the aging and dying tissues of the body.\n\nSome areas of the brain show senescence, that is, cell death, because they are over-populated with cells that will be dead in less than 5 years. These include the thalamus in the brain, the striatum in the spinal cord, the anterior cingulate area of the brain, and the occipital or outer-ear area of the brain.\n\nThe degree of senescence in a particular part of the body is a measure of the overall health of that particular organ. Senescence is increased in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, and respiratory tract. Liver senescence is usually caused by cirrhosis that can result from the accumulation of fatty and oxidized substances. Liver senescence may also be caused by the action of viral infections such as hepatitis and cystic fibrosis. Gastric cancer occurs most often in patients with cirrhosis. The degree of liver senescence is a measure of the amount of chronic inflammation in the liver. Senescent cells accumulate in the liver with inflammation of the liver cells. The degree of liver senescence also is a measure of the length of time a person has been on a low-fat diet or on a medication that suppresses tissue inflammation.\n\nRenal dysfunction may be caused by many causes, including viral infections and the action of certain medications. Renal, or kidney, tissue undergoes senescence over time, but in the longer term this is most often due to damage being done by a bacterium, such as the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, or from excess production of acid-base mediators in the kidney that cause dehydration and a loss of sodium from the blood. Senescent cells can also be caused by the action of certain drugs, such as methotrexate, which can trigger a chronic low-level inflammatory response.\n\nAlzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia and progressive dementia, involves senescent cells. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of a cellular protein called beta amyloid. This protein is abnormal because it becomes oxidized as it accumulates. This leads to the formation of senile plaques and, eventually, to the development of the progressive dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSensitive Sensitivities", "label": 1, "id": 100054}

{"text": "Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran established the Baran-Walter principle that there are two basic ways to determine whether or not a complex system is stable. The first is to observe every possible outcome, which is called sequence analysis. A second way to do this is to look at the patterns of events over time. The two approaches are related because they provide two different points of view that may not overlap at all. Sequence analysis begins with all possible outcomes, but this gives a very loose definition of stability. Any outcome a computer can recognize as successful has already happened, and the sequence analysis method simply doesn't try to observe it.\n\nSequence analysis can reveal a system's stability if and only if a sequence of events, as it grows in complexity, starts to develop characteristics and routines that prevent the system from ever getting out of control or crashing. In other words, it takes a sequence of outcomes, looks for the behaviors or routines they give rise to and looks for what prevents them from occurring again. It then looks for a pattern or pattern of cause and effect in the sequence of events that will prevent both those outcomes and the systems that can cause those outcomes from happening again. A system that seems stable must be stable by either sequence analysis or by an observation of the patterns that can prevent it from ever becoming unstable.\n\nWhen we look at computer programs, the simplest examples are linear time or sequential programs that have a fixed internal state and return only an integer number of output arguments, i.e., if the output argument is larger than zero, the program calculates the number and outputs an integer. (The Java programming language uses a similar principle.) In this simple model, you must either stop a program (either with a debugger or the end-of-program condition) or else return the input and count the number of exceptions. This system becomes more unstable with time. First, it's easy to forget that exceptions are exceptions and not good values for input. Second, once you've stopped a program, the order of the inputs and outputs is no longer fixed. For example, if that program stops for a loop, then it stops for a while, then stops again, then repeats with an argument of different length. Even if you can predict everything that will happen, the order of events is unpredictable. When they run out of input arguments, you cannot look up a count to return at the end. Without further analysis, a computer has no idea when it has reached the end of the sequence and crashed.\n\nIt has taken programmers over the years many years of research to discover that an even more interesting system exists. This is what we call a random number generator, or rng. rng is a kind of computer algorithm that produces some number from arbitrary numbers given a time series of inputs, each input representing some condition in the time-series. A rng starts out in a state called the start state, whose only requirement is that the input numbers all have the same magnitude and same distribution as each other. To learn more about rngs, I recommend reading the classic paper by W. T. Mitchell, Random Riddles of Life, Random Riddles of Nature by Peter D. L. Johnson, and Robert E. Howard, Jr. (in English and in Arabic), all published in 1966. The rng algorithm itself is much easier in practice. Even a modest program can create a sequence of outcomes after a fraction of a second if your machine has a fast processor. (I will be demonstrating the algorithm in a very simple case later and explain how to create this sequence.)\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please email me at rng.program@gmail.com.\n\nIf you are using any pre-existing code from this article, please contact me at rng.program@gmail.com.", "label": 1, "id": 100056}

These are just some suggestions; I can't offer the same level of expertise as to your tinnitus symptoms because of the lack of knowledge about such a life-altering and fascinating condition.\nIt is a really great idea to always have a list of all your equipment and medical knowledge at your disposal. \u00a0It can help immensely if you are able to ask friends, family, co-workers or strangers for advice. \u00a0 \u00a0\nLastly, it is important to remember that you truly can't control what sounds you hear; the only thing you can control is what you look for when you hear annoying noises.\nThat said, the tinnitus symptom you are most likely to hear is the buzzing in your ears. \u00a0Once you learn how to differentiate between the two, things will be easier. \u00a0For your tinnitus headaches, it may go as long as you want. This is not a problem.\u00a0\nThis is a real problem.\nHere is a list of places you can look if you are having problems with other annoying sounds:\u00a0\nI hope this has helped shed some light on this really interesting condition.\nIf you have been having trouble believing this, consider that some of the largest institutions with advanced audiology programs have tinnitus symptoms, as do most private and community audiology clinics.\nIf you find that there are times you believe you would benefit from treatment on the tinnitus front, I recommend having your doctor put your case on the table, so you can get an honest answer from them. \u00a0This really can be a life-altering experience for someone with tinnitus.\nTinnitus is a real problem.\nI believe that this article does a marvelous job at providing information on both tinnitus and tinnitus treatment options.\nAgain, these are two great conditions, both associated with sound that can cause hearing damage. \u00a0Tinnitus is extremely troublesome, and has severe implications for the treatment of high-risk patients in general. \u00a0 \u00a0\nIt is also important to understand that the tinnitus symptoms you are experiencing do not necessarily relate directly to tinnitus. \u00a0You may experience some, but not all, of these symptoms, and if you are experiencing a lot of them, it might be a sign that you want to talk about tinnitus with a hearing health specialist. \u00a0 \u00a0It can be a complex condition.\u00a0\u00a0\nLastly, it is also very important that you understand that tinn", "label": 1, "id": 100058}
{"text": "two questions that naturally arise in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar interactions:\n\n1. Are the two stars in different orbits around the black hole?\n\n2. Which are moving faster or slower than the rest of the galaxy?\n\nI'll give myself an edge by working a bit more in the \"X-Physics\" area. I find the orbital distances of the two stars and their velocities for themselves relatively easy to calculate:\n\nStar X is a K-type star at the center of a binary system \u2013 not quite a K-type star (you might call it a H-type star). I'll go with a K-type star. The speed of the black hole at the center of the binary system is v ~ 2.2 times that of all other galaxies. (Or, in this case, v/0.3.) The velocity of X is g. g \u2248 v g, so it goes fast enough to travel to Earth in about a day \u2013 or about ten thousand days. The combined mean speed of all other galaxies is v ~ 8.4X (where X is a K-type solar system).\n\nIn any case, I've got the two stars at rest on the surface of a galaxy. They're in one plane:\n\nIf the two stars on opposite sides of the galaxy have the same mass, velocity, angular speed or other properties, the two systems can and should be able to interact:\n\nIf both stars move at the same velocity, they can interact with each other \u2013 and if one star does so more frequently, the other does so more rarely.\n\nIn this case the two stars should collide and merge. In that case the two stars can collide with each other and then the two stars could collide with each other; and then the two stars could collide again.\n\nThe gravitational forces in this case are pretty powerful \u2013 so if either star were really tiny (~9 solar masses) and the other star was more massive, the black hole would destroy the smaller star, not the larger star. The merger and/or annihilation of the two stars would cause the collapse of the galaxy. Because these two stars are moving in opposite directions, we can't see that the merger has happened \u2013 in fact it's much more likely that the two stars have collided and simply bounced off each other.\n\nIn this case:\n\nI'll give myself an edge by working in the \"N-Physics\" area. I'll figure out how to simulate a pair of stars that are not moving at their own separate speeds. But I figure it out. How will I know? Oh, I'll figure it out. No, I really won't. It'll be hard \u2013 I'll have to work in a special way that simulates how stars interact based on the velocity between the stars, and I'll work in another special way that simulates not just the size of the stars (e.g. the mass), but the mass of them, the color of the stars, and so on.\n\n(Note: In the \"N-Physics\" area, I'm going to assume that the two stars travel in circles around a black hole. I'll only consider the case where they are moving at the same velocity, for simplicity. This will make it possible to keep the assumption of a spherical black hole \u2013 I'll even use the same mathematical technique to move the stars. Of course, it is also possible to ignore this assumption and think of a black hole as a ball with a point inside, like in the movies.)\n\nSo, I'll work the problem for stars moving around inside a black hole. I won't simulate the star, the interaction between stars inside a black hole, or any interaction outside of a black hole. Again, it has to be done in a clever way that I find in the \"X-Physics\" area. I'll give myself an edge by trying to find a nice equation that simulates stars in a black hole moving about the black hole.\n\nOf course, this is an almost trivial problem \u2013 if I find an equation that is correct for me that describes stars in a black hole, I'll know there is a problem. For example, the speed the black hole can have depends on the mass of the black hole \u2013 not the speed, the size.\n\nAlso of interest is that this problem can be used to simulate interactions between stars that don't involve the black hole and the stars will not be moving around the black hole alone:\n\nI'll give myself an edge by studying and working on the \"K-Physics\" area \u2013 this is where I'll work with stars that are moving around the entire galaxy! But I'll work in a special way, that we will define later. I'll also give myself an edge by writing small programs that I'll compile to code that I can run on some microcontroller as a demo \u2013 this will be useful in getting some feedback for the", "label": 1, "id": 100059}

This makes them an excellent reference frame for understanding the evolution of the Universe.\n\nIt was first found in 1829 by Galileo Galilei, while he was aboard the \"Sailing Ball\", an 18-magnitude comet in search of its origin. It was discovered when a small ball of iron passing in front of the comet was observed to be deflected significantly, at least 1 degree, in its direction from the comet. Although the initial finding was not published, some subsequent work published in the Astrophysical Journal eventually gave it its modern name. While there was no evidence of a magnetic influence in the comet, a subsequent attempt by the British scientist James Ramsay at a correlation between the deflections of metal spheres in front of comets and their orbits showed a significant correlation.\n\nIn general relativity, the deflections of light caused by an object's gravitational field are converted to velocities and referred to a \"gravito-electromagnetic potential (GEMP)\", which is defined as:\n\n$$V = \\sqrt{ \\frac{8\\pi G}{3\\pi r^2} - v\\sqrt3 } $$\n\nwhere $g = (0, 1)$ is the gravitational constant, $r = r_0/4$ is the rotation rate in radians per minute, and $v$ is the velocity in meters per second squared. The GEMP increases as the sphere experiences more and more acceleration in its path.\n\nThe GEMP also governs the gravitational fields, for example Newton's gravitational constant and the Doppler Doppler shift is controlled by the g-factor (or g-shift) of the gravitational field.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantum mechanics there are quantised values that we can express in terms of an object's position but the GEMP is not affected by these mathematical quantities.\n\nThe two quantities $V$ and $a$ are usually written as the quantum quantities that describe the gravitational field in a direction that is perpendicular with the vector $v$.\n\nIn physics, the relativistic value of $V$ is often called the \"v-vector\". It is often written in an abbreviation such as $\\rho$, $\\rho$, or $R$.\n\nNote: the relativity equations differ from the classical ones, in the interpretation of light and other quantities. The classical version of the equations state that the position of an observer does not actually change due to the action of gravity (since time is conserved). However, in the relativistic version, the apparent position changes during the duration of an acceleration that could be felt by the object.\n\nSince the relativistic version does not change the time it is useful as a reference frame: the term \"time\" when used in physics is always \"relativistic time\".", "label": 1, "id": 100061}

Measles is transmitted through the breath or tears of an infected person. Rubella infection can also be contracted from close contact with an infected person. The virus is most often transmitted to an infant when an infected person blows his or her nose onto a breast or other mucous membrane. According to CDC, around 6 in 200 babies born to mothers who test positive for rubella in pregnancy (and who are not vaccinated or have not followed the recommended schedule of vaccines) will die before their first birthday, while between 6 in 100 babies born to mothers who test negative have no adverse effects from rubella.\n\nWhy It's important to vaccinate\n\nChildren who get vaccination for any of the following causes can contract deadly diseases which can be easily spread to others through contaminated water, food, etc:\n\nDiabetes\n\nPneumonia/Suffering from a severe disease such as malaria\n\nLeukema Virus\n\nLupus\n\nDiabetes and diabetes-related conditions such as high blood pressure, low birth weight and metabolic syndrome\n\nLupus is usually caused by a virus called Rokitansky's Arthritis and causes rashes and other symptoms during adolescence.

A man got on with a list, but it included \"mangrove\" for trees or vegetation, and the phrase \"mangroves\" appeared in the title. That sparked the usage of \"mondo\", as the Portuguese for \"mangroves\", after which \"mangrove\" developed as \"mondo mungo\", which in turn gave rise to \"mangrove\". The word is still being used for trees in the tropical regions of the world, and in the world of maritime travel, where \"mangroves\" has long been a common travel phrase in port cities, even if the ocean waters are miles away.

{"text": "I wrote last week that the ACC is currently on track to lose 12-16 games for the first time since its 1999 national championship run. I believe this is a fair assessment. The league as a whole is ailing and in the midst of a complete rebuild that has to begin from scratch; with the league's flagship school, Virginia, set to become independent in 2017 it's no wonder the conference can't seem to turn a profit in any one year. What can't be ignored is how far off from a championship shot the ACC is right now.\n\nThe league's flagship school, Virginia, is set to become an independent in 2017.\n\nA handful of teams have made the postseason two years running, but the majority doesn't at all. The ACC has won just 10 of its 14 conference championships since 1996 and its worst football season in over a decade. It has not won a conference title since 2007, hasn't finished a single season under.500 since the 1990s, and now is in the midst of its first six-loss season in 21 years. This is where we start to see where the gap falls between the ACC and national champions.\n\nThe ACC's future is looking pretty bleak.\n\nThat's why it's no surprise the conference is planning a massive overhaul. More than a hundred conference schools are expected to join as part of an overall expansion of the program.\n\nThe ACC isn't getting any younger, either. It is projected to lose at least 300 students in its current 10 schools over the course of the coming decade. This isn't exactly a pretty future for any fan, especially one like me who grew up with the league on one end of a national broadcast, hoping the ACC could one day contend for a title again.\n\nThe ACC is losing the ability to field a championship team in the next decade to other Power 5 conferences and other major football conferences, which means the league will be reduced to teams like Clemson trying to catch up at a slower pace.\n\nThis is a devastating blow to the league's fans. The ACC's fans have watched the league's most prominent program slip in quality for years. They've endured countless ACC Network commercials, ridiculous television ad campaigns, poor conference marketing choices, and a slew of non-conference opponents that would seem far removed from a conference championship.\n\nIf anything it just makes the league's demise that much easier to take.\n\n\"The reason I care about the ACC is because of those rivalries,\" said Mike Bowers, who is responsible for recruiting several Power Five prospects with the Virginia Cavaliers. \"I feel like the ACC's programs have really gotten out of sync and the ACC has really fallen behind.\"\n\nBowers has played many Power 5 football games with Virginia recruits, including former ACC coaches in Frank Beamer and Jim Harbaugh. They both told him it was tough making it out to practice at times, which leads to questions about the league's future.\n\n\"I think there are kids that were just really disappointed at the end of the day,\" Bowers said. \"The football conference has been so dormant. You know, a couple of years ago they got that ACC media rights deal on the table. They went on the road a couple of years ago. They've been on TV a few times. There's nothing there for the players that are recruiting in the ACC to think 'Oh, we can play this rival anymore.'\"\n\nBowers mentioned Alabama as a team that's seen the deepest decline within the SEC.\n\n\"When you see somebody like Alabama who was able to break out before it got to that point in the SEC maybe because of that rivalry, that's something that's still lacking,\" Bowers said. \"It's something that makes all the rest of us miss how it used to be; where they had that big title game. Where was that five-year period? Where were they when LSU was coming and Florida State was coming? When is there going to be a championship run? I tell people we just really don't think the ACC can make it.\"\n\nBowers also believes some current ACC players like he and other top recruits don't understand the caliber of talent in the league or the impact it can have.\n\n\"You see kids go there who probably were on teams that were just on the bubble early on, and they are probably thinking of the college as a bigger opportunity, and, in some cases, they're probably right,\" Bowers said. \"But once they get to college they realize that there are people that are going great, that are going to get to the highest level. They just don't see that outside of the ACC. I don't think it's about that.\"\n\nWith the league's television contracts ending soon in many major markets the next couple of years and a significant number of schools moving outside of the conference for the first time, the ACC is looking at a possible exodus of top talent.\n\nThat leaves coaches like Bowers", "label": 1, "id": 100064}

The short-period ejecta from the SMC could be part of a new type of planetary impactor: a super-asteroid or a fragment of a white dwarf. In the present study, we also investigate the effects of the short-period ejecta on the evolution of stars, as well as the distribution of this material on the interstellar disk; that is, we also investigate whether the mass and/or the impact ejecta of super-injectors have a strong influence on the early evolution of their host stars.

Most commonly, it has been associated with a blood infection caused by tapeworms, the council says. People in their 20s and 30s have been most affected, with up to one in 10 adults being infected. The council recommends immunisation up to 20 months after becoming infected, with the age of adulthood as a starting point. \"There's no good evidence suggesting people become 'immune' to this infection because you are already susceptible,\" the council's Michael Gillett said. The council would like people over 30 to be vaccinated for H. histolytica infection.\n\nH. histolytica has been around for millions of years, so there's nothing to fear from its spread, Dr Gillett said. \"It's the age of the person and the number of infections that should be considered,\" he said. Health authorities say there's no specific treatment for the bug, but it can be controlled with antibiotics and immunisations. However, they warn pregnant women and people who are HIV-positive, as well as HIV-infected people, must be alert to the possibility of H. histolytica infection. There is no immunity to the infection and once the bacteria reaches a child, it can progress with only a few symptoms. Dr Gillett said a lack of information on \"what to do if you are exposed\" and a lack of awareness of the risk of the virus made people feel \"neglected and unwell or unsure whether they could get infected\".

These findings are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of the shock waves. We observe the main shock, a high-temperature helium-vacancy (HV) shock, of Sno-1617 in which most of the gas energy becomes converted into kinetic energy at high velocities and high temperatures. We also report observations of the shock wave propagating around the star before the explosion, which have previously never been considered in similar studies. Such high speed shock evolution of the gas is unique for a Sn/L type supernova and may be a consequence of the fast expansion of the host galaxy, which is not observed in many other SNs.

{"text": "objective stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen that causes sepsis in hospitals and nursing homes. We describe the first description of an in vitro isolate that can cause sepsis in humans by inducing a multifocal necrotic lesion, which was characterized as a necrotic stroma, a necrotic cavity (not a necrotic lymphoedema), and a necrotic septum at both ends of the lesion. The necrotic stroma contained inflammatory cells, including myeloid cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells, as well as lymphocytes, platelets, and leukocytes. Nesciati et al. proposed two hypotheses to explain this pathogenesis in humans, including the hypothesis that the necrotic stroma resulted from necrotic cell death caused by interleukins released by the septic lesion and cytokines released in response to LPS (7). The investigators proposed that the necrotic lesion would likely be associated with a large necrotic ulcer for the treatment of which it is critical to identify and isolate the causative agent. We described this isolate, which resulted in severe sepsis and fatal intravascular coagulation (8). The investigators and all others who have reported this phenomenon have interpreted this finding in the context of other, similar isolates including the Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7 isolates that have caused intravascular coagulation and septic shock (9\u201313). However, the fact that necrotic septum has been described using cell culture and noninvasive methods such as culture of urine samples has not been described prior to our study.\n\nMaterials and Methods We performed culture using the modified Kiehl's broth medium to distinguish between the three main types of bacterium, the most closely related to Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7 (Streptomyces aeruginosa, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7). We performed all PCR procedures that were performed in the laboratories of our co-authors. All isolates had been identified from patients in our own hospitals or in local hospitals associated with Kaiser Permanente and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. One of our coauthors from the Kaiser Permanente medical center participated in all samples obtained; all samples were handled by another coauthor, a microbiologist (C. C. C. K. and L. K. H.). Samples with the same type of bacterium or similar clinical history were separated by a molecular identification method (13). A consensus pathogenicity signature was obtained in each of these isolates (13). The isolates from the San Francisco General Medical Center were used as controls. Briefly, for each of our study isolates, the culture supernatant or culture-negative smears and supernatants were incubated with anti-SMSP-1 (A821) or anti-SMSP-2 (B821) IgG and anti-SMSP-1 IgG (in duplicate) or with the same type of bacterial antigens as SmaI-IgG, SmcI-IgG, SmcI-IIgG, SmcII-IgG, SmcII-IIgG, SmcII-IIhG, SmcII-IgH, SmcII-, Smc-, or SmcIII-IgG (in duplicate) (12) in the range of 1:200 to 1:800 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a Lactobacillus brevis growth broth culture (Becton Dickinson). Cells in the growth medium were then incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-SMSP-I (A821) and SmaI-IgG (R&D Systems) (12) in the range of 1:100 to 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature in a Lactobacillus brevis growth broth culture (Becton Dickinson). The same SmaI-IgG or SmcI-IgG (in duplicate) was used as SmaI-IgH, SmcI-IIgH, SmcII-IIgg, SmcIIhG, SmcII-IgH (in duplicate) against the smears from 2 different patients.

They are generally composed of air bubbles that result from the rapid influx of blood into the lungs during respiration. Although these air spaces do not contribute to blood pressure elevation, they may have an impact on the distribution of venous pressure in the lung parenchyma and on pulmonary pressure measurements. The formation of the plaques is not associated with any clinical signs or symptoms of shock.\n\nPeritoneal Abscess\n\nThe peritoneal cavity contains some of the most common body fluids involved in the blood-flow regulation. There is some evidence that some of these body fluid constituents may contribute to the blood-flow regulation of the lungs. Peritoneal abscesses are the noninfectious development of an abscess in the peritoneal cavity. The infection may be due to systemic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and chagas disease.\n\nOccasionally, a patient with a pulmonary peritoneal abscess develops a clinical syndrome characterized by fever, nausea / vomiting, abdominal pain, and the production of high levels of bilirubin which may present with cyanosis, tachycardia, a decrease in cardiac output, and a decrease in perfusion of platelets in the coronary arteries (hypovolemic vasospasm) and the carotid arteries (ischemic vasospasm ). However, a large proportion of such patients with acute hemorrhage do not develop significant clinical symptoms with the exception of peripheral neuropathy. The primary cause of the abscess is the infection with a pulmonary microorganism. This type of infection is uncommon but may occur after the formation of a pulmonary arteritis.\n\nPulmonary Abscesses are seen primarily as subepithelial lesions, which may cause extensive scarring of the peritoneum, ulceration of the internal abdominal wall, or other peritoneal neoplasia.\n\nLobular Acute Abscess\n\nAs previously described, a small (a few millimeters across at most), intravascular collection of blood within the pulmonary lobes, from which a large amount of blood accumulates, and which develops into a blood-flow-regulating peritubular abscess. Larger hemorrhagic abscesses occur in acute pyelonephritis; there may also be a secondary (necrotic) process.\n\nPericardial Epidemic\n\nA pulmonary hemorrhage that is a result of a pericardial effusion. The pericardium and the pleural cavity are involved.\n\nPeritoneal Abscess\n\nA small (a few millimeters across at most) intravascular collection of blood within the lungs, from which a large amount of blood accumulates, and which develops into a peritoneal perforation.\n\nPericardial Inflammatory Disease\n\nA chronic inflammatory process on the pericardium as a result of pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium.\n\nPeritubular Intussusception\n\nIn some patients with pulmonary vascular disease, a peritubular accumulation of inflammatory cells occurs in peritoneal fluid. It is composed of blood clots and non-dissociated inflammatory cells (erythoid epithelial cells). These cells have become associated with fluid and may be associated with a decreased perfusion.\n\nPeritubular Intussusception is characterized by: (1) the presence of pleural fluid, which can be thin or thick; (2) an abnormally large number of these inflammatory cells present in the pleural fluid; and (3) a decreased volume of the pleural fluid (due to the increased pleural filling). These fluid-associated cells are seen throughout the peritoneal cavity and have high molecular weight as a result of the fact that the cells are poorly attached to the endothelial cells.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\n\nPulmonary emboli arise from the rupture of small vessel walls in the lungs, usually during surgery. When the walls rupture, the pulmonary blood flow is interrupted and the vessel rupture spreads to the adjacent heart.\n\nEvaluating a patient for pulmonary embolism is usually made by obtaining a bronchoscopic exam to examine for edema, pneumothorax, and pulmonary edema.

{"text": "we propose a mechanism for the origin of the galactic habitable zone. The first stages involve massive stars evolving into red giants, which then evolve to brown dwarfs (1). The last stage involves stars evolving into a white dwarf, which either survives collapse or becomes a galaxy black hole (2).\n\nThe formation of the habitable zones for all types of stars are governed by the time scales of 2\u201315 Gyr (Fig. 1). The present epoch is known as the \"Big Bang\". A period of cosmic time lasting 2 Gyr is considered the \"transitional\" phase of the history of the universe, between the Big Bang and the present epoch. The Big Bang formed a universe that consisted of a single point of matter, a very hot, dense state. The \"inflation\" of the quantum fluctuations was completed in less than a billionth of a second (i.e., 1% of the age of the universe) (3, 4).\n\nAs stars evolved to become red giants, most evolved only slowly on the Earth. Red giants burn with an intensity that is comparable to that of a terrestrial star (5). The habitable zones of terrestrial stars can be found as points in a curve that is called the \"habitable zone of the stellar surface\", where the temperature of the star remains relatively constant [\u00b0 C ; \u00b0 K, as in \u00b0 K; \u00b0 K = \u22121.0 + 1.0 x10\u221214 W m\u22122 (6)].

Here the planet Earth resides on the most \"hot\" part of the spectrum, at about 550\u2013650 K (\u00b0 C ). Most terrestrial exoplanets are even temperate, or slightly cooler. Our nearest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri Bb, is a white dwarf (8), and would be within its habitable zone by about 10\u201375 K; whereas super-Earthlike planets are typically rocky planets orbiting inside of their host stars' habitable zones, often in the \"habitable zenith\" or \"habitable extreme edge\".\n\nFig. 1. Period of life on Earth estimated as 1 Gyr.\n\nThe first Earth-sized exoplanet found in a habitable zone by radial velocity observations was GJ 436b in 2005 (7), but it was not discovered until 2010 (8). A total of 30 terrestrial exoplanets were found to be in this habitable area in 2015, two of which are potentially habitable (9). About 200 more exoplanet candidates can be considered to have a 50\u201375% chance of being in a habitable zone (10).\n\nThe main challenges of finding habitable exoplanets is to define the time scale of habitable zones. This is done by measuring their orbital periods in solar-system units (SUs). In the context of habitable exoplanets, there are three SUs (11), for each type of star, which vary in length of day and in the orbital period of the planet. The main advantage of SUs is that they are relatively simple to compute and can be used as a general time scale of habitable exoplanet orbits (see below).\n\nA habitable exoplanet is considered \"habitable\" if its total mass is below 0.8 au and its radius does not deviate from zero. (The planet surface temperature is then, in this case, given by h; where h is the actual temperature.) The habitable zone for habitable exoplanets is then defined by the average distance between the planet and its host star [d = d_1 + d_2 + \u2026.d_r ]2.\n\nOne problem with SUs is that the size of the earth itself differs within a few per cent as the result of tidal heating (12). In other words, for every day the earth is the same size, it will have different diameters according to the radius of the earth, which would also differ with the orbital period of the planet and the planetary orbital elements.\n\nA new method of determining the orbital periods of habitable exoplanets is based on the stellar parallax. The stellar parallax is defined as: h = \u222b \u03c3 e sin \u2061 [ X i, t ] ( X i ) = h d i = h ( X i + X t ). (13) The stellar parallax can be used to calculate the time scale of the planets, as long as the stellar host element can be determined.\n\nThe solar mass and the stellar radius are known for a relatively large number of stars at present. For example, in 1987, HST data on 36 stars were available for comparison (14). This allowed the evaluation of stellar parallax for 34 of them. In 1997, this number was increased to 81 stars. In 2003, for comparison, the data of 7,852 stars were available in the HARPS-NExS survey (15). For 6", "label": 1, "id": 100076}

Earlier this month, Hawking warned of the consequences of the discovery of these strange objects, claiming black holes may not actually exist\n\nThis image of a possible supernova (in red) that could have occurred after a massive explosion in the centre of the Milky Way is superimposed onto a rendering of the cosmic microwave background\n\nThe astrophysicist explained that the only way for these 'unknown objects to form is if they orbit each other extremely close to where they formed'.\n\n'However, there is no reason to expect that such orbits should occur in real life,' according to Nasa.\n\n'Instead, we would expect to find more-closer orbits, where a black hole is much nearer the center of the galaxy than might be expected.'\n\nIf that were the case, 'it seems likely that such objects can be as energetic or even more energetic than the black holes that form in the cores of galaxies like our own'.\n\nAt present, the best way to detect these mysteries is through the development of more powerful telescopes to look at very dim and distant objects.\n\nSince a black hole's gravity is so strong, the gravitational waves (ripples like raindrops on a pond) it emits are so tiny'most of them are undetected without advanced telescopes'.\n\nAs such, astronomers are now studying the properties of a new infrared background created by collisions between two neutron stars that occurred 14.5 billion years ago.\n\nThis light is actually the leftover glow of intense radiation given off by the two black holes.\n\nHawking believes his theory could uncover the mysteries of how black holes formed, how they are born and why they go through cycles that could last decades.\n\nHe said: 'Our observations of the gravitational radiation that superluminal objects emit may help to tell us the true nature of black holes.'", "label": 1, "id": 100077}
{"text": "a gibbs operator @xmath0 for a 2d lattice system with 6 components (@xmath1) and @xmath2. (You can see it on this plot of the plane, for example).\n\nThe key feature is that these expressions become \"linear maps\" in the sense that when you apply the operator to a point on the plane, the result is a linear transformation of that space. This \"linearity\" property was first introduced by (at about the same time as) Gabor Szabo (and later discovered by the logistic operators Gabor H. Nader and John Tukey), and is generally known as \"linearity\". It is a property which is needed to be able to map an image to an original image, in much the same way as being able to map a graph to itself, a point to itself, or a polynomial to itself.\n\nAnd the linearity property allows you to map the space into space:\n\nThis image is a \"vector\" of \"points\" @n1, @n2, @n3.\n\nOf course this isn't exactly what this image is supposed to represent. After all, it's all points to which a dot product applied to a unit vector corresponds. But the point itself is a linear transformation of the space. A linear transformation in this sense is, on its own, just another vector, represented by the linear operator:\n\nThe point's vector is represented by the linear operator as a line segment through the point:\n\nAnd this line segment represents the original image in space (in this case, the space of unit vectors @n1, @n2, @n3).\n\nIt's easy to see that every other part of the network \u2013 its nodes (@n1, @n1) and its edges (@n2) and such \u2013 are also vectors.\n\nIn fact, any linear transformation of this space can be written in the form of a linear operator on the basis of this space. However, the linear operator will be a matrix of size 4\u00d74, and its element (a 1d vector) will not simply add to its component (a 2d vector): It will carry a value of 1 and must be multiplied by @0 to get it.\n\nNow that we're all familar with \"linearity\" we can make use with this to describe our network. The key idea is that every line segment within the network can be modeled as a linear transformation of its components: A point's vector as a linear operator through the point and its edge @n1 as a linear operator through the edge and @n1 as a linear operator through itself.\n\nNow that we've defined a point\u2013edge\u2013linear operator, the rest is easy: We just want to be able to sum over a 2d space the line segments created by those operators, and define a 1d matrix of size 4\u00d74 with the sum as the input to the operator.\n\nFor example:\n\nAs you can see, each line segment is represented by a matrix which equals one element in the matrix:\n\nAnd then its element has the same value as:\n\nAnd of course this matrix has the same shape as a vector in the 1d space \u2013 a 1d vector with a 1 as the value:\n\nSo we can now say that those lines are points. Any line segment which is represented by a 1d vector in the 1d space is also represented by a @n1 point.\n\nWhat is \"an image\", anyway?\n\nThe image shown above is the original image \"as seen\" in the network. However, it is not an image in the linear sense: Because we're actually performing the network itself as the input to our linearizers, the output of that equation is a 2d image of the network.\n\nThe image above is the same picture as before, but in the 2d space of the linearizer. That 2d image shows what the network is seeing, when in fact our 2d image is just a collection of points.\n\nIn other words, our network is not an image in the linear sense, because it is not an input to a linearizer, and it is not an output because it is something that is visible by itself.\n\nHow is the linearization applied?\n\nWe define a linearized formula of width 1 in the dimension space of the network's components. The input component to the linearizer is our 2d matrix, and the output is a 2d matrix.\n\nGiven the 2d matrix @y(x) in dimension space \u2014 which is just the matrix @x(1) + @y(10) \u2014 and a constant vector @x(1) and a point @y(x), we are now able to find a linearization formula, which we apply to the 2d input from", "label": 1, "id": 100078}

You should get a hypothyroid test every year at least until you are 45 years (older women can get a test as early as 25).\n\nIn the US, more than 1 million women have hypothyroidism. Most of these women have atypical disease. In some cases, the hormone and parathyroid glands are not working properly.\n\nHypothyroidism is common in women whose periods stop. In some cases, hypothyroidism is a sign of cancer as these patients are over treated with thyroid hormone and not enough thyroid growth.\n\nAccording to the WHO, around 10 to 15 per cent of women have severe hypothyroidism. According to the International Association of Thyroid Associations, about 2 to 4 per cent of patients will develop some type of thyroid problem which will need treatment. And, half of these patients also will develop hypothyroidism after treatment. They usually develop it during the early pregnancy and during pregnancy.\n\nHow can be treated this disease?\n\nThe main treatments for hypothyroidism are thyroid hormone therapy.\n\nTreatment may help a patient's thyroid gland to work normally. Other treatments may include medication that will alter the thyroid hormone and/or parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the body.\n\nTreatment is difficult when the treatment is not effective.\n\nAccording to the British Thyroid Association, if you are diagnosed with thyroid malfunction, you can receive hormone replacement therapy as per the instructions of your doctor. You can get a hormone replacement therapy if your doctor says you need to treat a problem with thyroid function and/or the blood circulation is affected.\n\nYou can get hormone replacement therapy from the patient.\n\nHormones like thyroxine, T4 and T3 must be given. But, you need to follow the dosage guidelines set by your doctor.\n\nThe dosage for taking hormonal therapy includes the amount of thyroid hormone ( T4 ) and/or the amount of thyroid hormone hormone replacement (T3).\n\nIt is also necessary to take a supplement that will replace any thyroid hormone that are missing.\n\nYou may need to take a medication if you also have hypothyroidism.\n\nMost patients with hypothyroidism will become hypothyroid after about 6 months. After two years, most patients with hypothyroidism will take medication in place of the natural thyroid hormone. Some patients with hypothyroidism will need to take thyroid hormone hormone Replacement medication even during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\nThis medication will help treat an underactive thyroid gland and maintain proper health of the thyroid gland.\n\nYou have to have a prescription from your doctor before using any medication. Many women with hypothyroidism in India take hormonal therapy and go for treatment regularly.\n\nYour hypothyroidism may also affect your blood pressure. So, your blood pressure is carefully checked with a blood pressure monitor before your treatment begins.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you must be told to do a test called Thyrotropin Stimulator Test (TSST). TSH can also be tested.\n\nIf there should be any irregularity to your blood test, you should have a call-up for a visit to your doctor to discuss you treatment options and get an accurate diagnosis.\n\nHypothyroidism may cause side effects like weight loss, fatigue, depression, low energy and weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nIf thyroid hormone deficiency occurs in the middle age and older women, it may affect their ability to get pregnant.", "label": 1, "id": 100079}

{"text": "had him pitted against a lone enemy, usually handicapped in some way, it could become a long battle of attrition, for instance. A quick-firing gun would be good if one was in the right place, but very effective if left to fly by itself, like a missile. It had a large firing arc (180\u00b0) and a very wide turning circle (4 km). This provided it with a lot of flexibility, so it could be programmed to engage any target with any amount of armor and at any angle.\n\nIt weighed 2.8 tons with a crew of only one and could reach a maximum speed of 36 km/h, which was the standard cruising speed of most tank destroyers at that time. However, the vehicle did not have a good armament and did not boast of better firepower than a medium tank. The tank was intended to be a \"tactical walker,\" capable of crossing long distances in a few minutes.\n\nIn June and July, the USSR put a couple of them into service, mainly for testing purposes. By mid-August, it was clear they were still being used in limited numbers. The Soviets also got several of these models, including a few prototypes.\n\nKV-1 was introduced to the Soviet Union in October of 1943, and entered production by 1945. The tank was designed by A.N. Yevgenyev, later the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of the Soviet Union and a former designer for the S-300 air defense system. Yevgenyev was tasked to design a vehicle to penetrate the armor of the Tiger I tank and the Panther III, so that the latter could be knocked out.\n\nAfter the project started, however, the problem the designers wanted to address was that the Tiger I and Panther were armed with the same 76.2 mm (3 in) main gun, which could penetrate the KV-1's frontal armor at almost 300 meters. Not only that, the armor thickness on the rear side of the turret was also as thick as the front.\n\nSoviet tanks are very heavily armed compared to their French counterpart, because the Russian military felt it necessary to be prepared for all possible situations. For example, the KwK 43 L/46 gun could fire both armour piercing rounds (AP shells, HEAT, even armor-piercing shrapnel rounds) or incendiary rounds. However, despite the fact that the Soviet military did not foresee anything like the armor of the Tiger I and Panther, they also still managed to fit the gun onto KV-1 tanks.\n\nDue to the increased weight of the hull armor of the KV-1, and the fact that the gun could only fire these high-explosive rounds, the design of the armor system of the tank had to change. To increase the protection of the tank, which was being built for armored warfare, the turret of the KV-1 was replaced with the improved version of the T-44 (known as the \"T-44B\") tank mantlet, equipped with an enlarged track skirt (called \"skis\") and a new glacis plate (known as \"panels\"). In addition, the turret ring of the tank was enlarged, as the tank's hull was not heavy enough to support such heavy weaponry. Therefore, the tank's front hull was armored, but its sides were not armored, to keep the machine guns from bouncing off of this new \"protected\" appearance. The armor was also more robust, to protect against shrapnel and AP rounds, and more resistant to armor piercing weapons.\n\nAfter the vehicle entered service, the KV-1's hull armor was not improved, but was improved upon. At the end of its service life, the KV-1 was still well protected but was not particularly fast. Its maximum speed was about 25 kph (15 mph).\n\nBecause of the KV-1's inability to penetrate the armor of the Panther tank, and the fact it did not have an anti-tank guided missile, this vehicle was not particularly effective in armored warfare. As a result, despite of the fact it was introduced in the late-war and its production was not greatly affected by the Kursk incident, the KV-1 in its production form was phased out by the beginning of the Vietnam War, and its use as a regular tank destroyer ended. Due to its extremely large production run, the KV-1 was also used extensively after the event, but since the vehicle was not fast enough to make up for the deficiencies, and the tanks of the time that could defeat the KV-1 (such as the T-80, later, the T-90 and the T-72) were already being fielded, the KV-1 ended its reign as a tank destroyer.\n\nSome early KV-1 tanks are also armed with a coaxial 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine gun.

You see the whole team's dedication to a job being wiped out in an instant \u2013 or so it seems.\n\nThe story itself is that we live in a time \u2013 somewhere between a few years in the future - where everything is controlled by computer programs called AIs. Well, to be more precise, everything is controlled and monitored by these very \"AI\" \u2013 but, in the movie, it's made to sound like the whole thing is controlled by a computer that only thinks like a human. We are told constantly that the AIs \"work\" for a man called M (Oscar Isaac) who is our protagonist. There is no mention of any real person in this storyline. No one has to be real or make sense. No one is important or significant in the story or the movies in general. M is completely disconnected from humanity and everyone else. This also makes him an attractive figure at first \u2013 he does not have to work, has no social life and only has a dream job of tracking down a fugitive called Dr. Z, who was taken from us by AIs. This is a great character development \u2013 but it fails because nobody in the world cares about this guy, he just spends the whole time trying to track down Dr Z and no one cares. And this is all to bring up that a guy called Dr. Z had a girlfriend named Laura (Ruth Negga) who just happens to turn out to be Dr. Z's ex-lover. She was taken away but then turns up all over the place. She runs the AIs.\n\nThe idea is this. M is called in to investigate Laura's disappearance and also an apparent alien abduction in Scotland. He finds his missing colleague (Kiefer Sutherland) and his boss (Liam Neeson). At first, they appear to be a team \u2013 but then they tell him to give up and walk away because they don't need him anymore. And then he discovers that this was all part of some scheme (we have not seen the end of it) and finds himself investigating things for himself, rather than being manipulated by the government. He comes across an AIs \"headquarters\" in a mysterious place and there is a huge computer room with a bunch of computers \u2013 all of which are connected over the internet. All of this is controlled by Z. Then we finally meet Dr. Z and we see exactly what this all means in terms of the story. No-one is real, nobody is important, everyone is meaningless and is only going to get in the way or get what they want once the job is done. It's like a Disney movie with AIs and no one cares.\n\nThe movie spends a lot of time doing some kind of montage of different locations in between scenes that are just there to tell us everything is in motion, going on or running at the same time.

When the distance to the field is measured, an observation must be made of the pulsing of the background light from within the tube.\n\nIt may be possible to determine the distance from the pulsating field using this method. However, this method should be used only if a very good background light is to be used.\n\n3. Observe the background light on an appropriate viewing screen; for example, a 60-inch flat screen will do. Measure the brightness of the luminance at the point of observation along a line of sight to the background light. The brightness of this luminance may then be directly compared with that in which the pulsing pulsed field intensity appears at the same place. The difference between the brightness measurements should appear constant over a length of the tube (or screen) of at least 1/2\".\n\nIf there is no pulsing, either the pulsing has no effect on the luminance at any place along the tube or the pulsing has been displaced from the tube.\n\n4. Calculate the value of the rotation speed\n\n5. Calculate the magnetic field strength at the moment of observation. This value must be known precisely\n\n6. Calculate the magnetization and radial magnetic field strength of pericyclic material with a minimum of instrument error.\n\n7. If this method is used, the value of magnetic field strength and rotation speed can now be determined.\n\n8. The magnetic field strength and rotation speed of the pericyclic material are proportional to the amount of magnetization in the plasma. Any rotation rate which results in a magnetic field magnitude less than the rotational velocity resulting from the rotational field density must be small.\n\nWhen rotating, the magnetic field intensity is directed to the center of the pericyclic material, where its field strength is diminished. There is a minimum of instrument error when the intensity of a pulsation is measured directly. This minimum error is approximately 2%.\n\nWhen rotating (or pulsing in the pericyclic material), the total rotation rate is equal to the rotation speed times the magnetization, and it is proportional to the magnetization. The total rotation rate is approximately twice the rotation speed, so the relative rotation speed also increases twice as the rotational velocity increases. The fraction of the total rotation rate due to magnetization therefore requires about half the total rotating speed to yield the ratio of the field strength to a certain specified value. This requirement is usually known or can be determined from observations of the pulsation or magnetization of the pericyclic material.\n\nIn the above experiments it is necessary to choose a size of tube of uniform diameter and thickness which will not be disturbed by", "label": 1, "id": 100084}
{"text": "in brief for the goals of reducing diabetic kidney disease and promoting lifelong health, the American Diabetes Association recommends that you increase and maintain your diet and exercise as follows:\n\nEat healthy -- a diet that is lower in carbohydrates and higher in healthy fats is essential. While the majority of carbohydrate-rich foods should be consumed daily, eating a few daily servings of low-carb snacks throughout the day (like a small piece of fruit or a low-calorie snack) will still limit the effects of high-carbohydrate foods such as candy and baked goods. Do not smoke -- smoking increases your risk for kidney damage and diabetes. Quit! Exercising -- moderate exercise helps prevent disease by improving insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels. Regular exercise is a beneficial part of a healthy diet and can help prevent even more serious diseases. Stay young -- a life in which you do not require dialysis or kidney transplants is a life with a lot more possibility and joy.\n\nWhy is high-carb dieting dangerous, then.\n\nAs we all know, high-carbohydrate diets lead to weight gain, loss of muscle mass and diabetes. High-carbohydrate diets have been linked to:\n\nMetabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions that are linked with many other health conditions.\n\nT2DM -- diabetes with severe complications.\n\nOther diseases -- such as osteoporosis, hypertension, and heart disease.\n\nLosing weight and losing weight fast has become another popular diet trend, but it is extremely difficult to follow if you have high levels of carbohydrate in your diet. Not only is it difficult to lose weight, but it can be incredibly difficult to gain it back.\n\nWhy is high-carb dieting dangerous?\n\nHigh-carb diets have been linked to the following conditions:\n\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nCardiometabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions that are linked with many other health conditions\n\nRisk of developing type II diabetes, an extremely serious and fatal disease; type II diabetes is an inability to make and use insulin properly\n\nLoss of bone mass, as well as a higher risk of fractures\n\nIncreased risk for cancer, including colon and breast cancer.\n\nIncreased risk for heart attack, stroke and stroke-related death\n\nLosing weight and losing weight fast has become another popular diet trend, but it is extremely difficult to follow for people who have high levels of carbohydrate in their diet.\n\nWhy shouldn't diabetes patients try a low-carb diet?\n\nEven though you would be doing yourself and your quality of life a favor by reducing your consumption of carbohydrates, dieting yourself back to a healthy body weight is almost impossible. High-carb diets can actually make you fatter, so you can see why some people believe they have to change their diet before they can lose more than a pound. They may think that you can get lean enough on a low-carb diet to be able to enjoy the benefits of weight loss without the risk of gaining weight back -- and so on. Unfortunately, low-carb diets are really no better than a \"normal\" diet of food packed full of the same carbohydrates in the same amounts. For that reason, patients with diabetes should not try to follow a \"low-carb diet\" unless they have a life-threatening condition like diabetes. It may be possible to lose weight on a low-carb diet with great success -- but only if you have already lost weight and are suffering serious complications.\n\nThe truth is, the only way to lose, get lean and stay healthy is to eat a variety of nutritious foods that are high in fat, fiber and protein, while avoiding the foods high in carbs.\n\nWhy low-carb diets don't work\n\nLow-carb diets have been associated with poor long-term results in studies by medical and nutritional scientists:\n\nPoor long-term results\n\nPeople who follow a low-carb diet lose weight slowly, but in the long term, they are more prone to developing diabetes and other complications.

{"text": "In science, alumni include astronomers Carl Sagan, a prominent contributor to The Night Sky; Bill Nye, the well-known host \"Science Guy;\" and former Harvard president Larry Summers, who is now a senior fellow at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\nThere is even a history within science to show that science is a very open and collaborative process. In his biography of Sagan, Lawrence Wright noted that Sagan and John von Neumann, another Nobel laureate in physics, went out for lunch in the late 1960s and \"discussed the possibility of co-operating on a series of landmark projects for humankind.\"\n\nIn the last few years of Sagan's life, he appeared onstage with Bill Nye \"the Science Guy\" in an ad for \"Science 2.0.\"\n\nBut as Science World noted in a 2014 article, The Scientific Consequences of 'Sagan's Death':\n\n\"After the death of his friend and mentor, Carl Sagan wrote Science 2.0, which was published in July 2015. The authors of the book had planned an anniversary event where John Gribbin \u2013 the co-author of Sagan's book Pale Blue Dot, and who co-authored Cosmos \u2013 would present \"Sagan the First\" lecture about a new, 20 to 30 minute version of the book, this time co-authored by Sagan and his daughter Ann Druyan.\"\n\nSagan also wrote an essay for the 2014 book, The Case for Mars:\n\n\"If my memory serves me well from my previous visits, we went into the dining room to discuss what might be the most important reason we should send humans to Mars \u2013 the preservation of our species.\"\n\nSagan also wrote a piece for Esquire in which he called the Apollo 11 moon landing \"a very powerful moment in history,\" and added its importance to a list of \"the greatest achievements in human history.\"\n\n\"There are many things about the moon that we know today because of Apollo, and yet, we have learned absolutely nothing about the origins of the solar system, or the origin of life \u2013 or the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe,\" wrote Sagan \"The most difficult thing about the Apollo mission was that it seemed to make no sense to anyone but us.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Scientific American, Sagan described how, in his mind, the moon walked, \"and that it just stood there for weeks, and you just thought, This can't be \u2026 you have to have some kind of explanation for that. \u2026\n\n\"And to me, the idea that it could have been made, by some sort of natural process, more than five decades ago, so long after the fact\u2026 It seemed preposterous to me.\"\n\nHe continued on the podcast the following year, discussing Apollo 11, \"that there were a tremendous number of questions left unanswered. \u2026 And with the loss of Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins [before the men set foot on the moon], [it] seemed to me perhaps we weren't going to have an answer. Neil had been such a tremendous hero \u2013 the greatest hero in my mind \u2013 even to someone like me, who'd been brought up as a science fiction kid. So when I heard that Neil Armstrong had died, I felt sick to my stomach.\"\n\nAccording to a 2014 Forbes piece on his retirement, Sagan \"didn't see his role as being an evangelist for science. He saw it as putting science into practice.\"\n\n\"The most interesting aspect of Carl Sagan's legacy,\" write Forbes, is that \"so many people don't realize he was so deeply invested in the cause; he worked on space programs in many countries; he served as NASA's director of planetary studies; and he wrote books devoted to space exploration.\"\n\n\"In the coming years, Sagan will likely be regarded as an icon of science but even before his passing, he was one of the greatest and most significant scientists of his generation,\" adds Forbes.\n\n\"Though we can't know how much he would have achieved had he lived, he was clearly passionate about science, its causes, and his role in its continued expansion,\" the article states.\n\nSagan was honored with an honorary doctorate of humanities from Princeton University in 2005.\n\n\"For the next decade or so, his memory will live in science, especially in those parts that were fortunate to benefit from his scientific gifts,\" according to the commencement speech the director of the Institute For Advanced Study gave in New York at the time.\n\nThough he left behind a massive body of work, many of his works have had value for decades to come. According to the website Encyclopedia Britannica, Sagan's two books on astronomy \"have a long literary history, as well as a continuing influence as teaching aids, and also serve as a valuable reference, and a great example of the use of graphic symbols in literature and media.", "label": 1, "id": 100086}
{"text": "kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) is the most frequent aids in this diagnosis. But the disease also shows other effects, including the skin enlargement (bony spurring) and the enlargement and enlargement of the bones (called osteophytic osteosclerosis). These complications are known to occur with sarcoma metastasis, but rarely because it is often impossible to establish a direct path from the tumor to tissues. However, the disease often results in a condition called bone metastasis (bone metastasis) where the tumor has spread to the bone. In other words, the tumor has infiltrated the bone before spreading to adjacent tissues.\n\nIn sarcoma, the primary tumor forms in the soft tissue around the bone. These secondary diseases of the bones are referred to as osteochondritis dissecans (ODS) and soft tissue sarcoma (SSS). ODS is a disease of the bone that occurs when the bone contains a large amount of cancerous cells that can form many different sites throughout the body. Other characteristics of ODS are osteoarthritis, which causes pain or swelling of the joint when the pressure on the joint increases, or osteomyelitis which is inflammation of the bone tissue and has no pain. Most ODS patients that show weakness of the shoulder do not have pain or signs of bone tumors as an indicator of the disease.\n\nSSS happens when the bones of the arm or leg contain a group of small blood vessels. These vessels, when filled, cause the pain and swelling that many people experience in such joint conditions of the hand or foot. Some people may also experience stiffness in the arm or leg in addition to pain and swelling in these conditions.\n\nTo determine if you have the disease, it's important to know the location and extent of the disease. However, when a sarcoma is present in the bone, especially a soft tissue sarcoma, it's very possible to miss it without even looking for the disease. The best indicator of bone disease is when there is pain in various parts of the body when someone stretches the skin of the affected area. If this is difficult to accomplish or painful, that's a good indication of the disease.\n\nOnce this type of problem is diagnosed, the type of treatment chosen should be based primarily on the type of disease it is. If it's the primary tumor, the tumor needs to be removed, with pain control and possible surgical treatment given to relieve this pain. If it's a secondary disease of the bones, it needs to be treated if possible.\n\nWhen symptoms are constant, a condition called secondary osteomyelitis of the arm or leg may be diagnosed from observation. If the swelling is less and pain is less often, this may indicate a secondary osteomyelitis, where the tumor hasn't been removed and the symptoms are caused by the osteomyelitis, which might be a complication of the tumor.\n\nDepending on the type of tumor, different forms of treatment may be needed. Patients with ODS and/or SSS should be carefully monitored while the bone is being treated. It's important to monitor to make sure they don't develop another bone tumor, which is possible if the condition continues. The best way to avoid that is to get regular x-rays. And it is important to treat them as soon as possible to monitor and reduce the progression of the disease.", "label": 1, "id": 100087}

{"text": "as often stated, a class of @xmath0 gravity models which rely strongly on the underlying physics of subatomic particles, and their effects on the universe at large, that they are quite different in form from other physics models. These include M-theory-based or nonabelian gravitation models in which the quantum interactions between matter, energy, and gravity, and the quantum field theory of the atom are incorporated into their equations, or the supersymmetric models in which all of the laws of physics are combined to yield a new \"superpartner\", or the string theory models in which the fabric of space and time itself is warped to produce the effect of gravity. There is, of course, no single \"best\" model of the universal or fundamental forces; but in general, this is a class of gravity models that are well suited to describing the underlying physics of subatomic particles.\n\nNote that, even in general, the laws of physics are more than just mathematical constructs; they vary significantly from one discipline to another. In physics, the \"laws of physics\" are not laws of physics, rather they are abstractions or abstract mathematical structures. One might think of them as abstract principles, rather than as actual \"laws\", for example as the \"laws of gravitation\" or the \"laws of motion\" are not the actual physical laws of physics but rather as abstract mathematical structures that have been \"established\" as the physical laws for certain fields of study, or as in the case of the laws of thermodynamics, not the actual laws but rather as the axioms of a theory that, at present, there are no testable predictions for (even with the use of many different experiments).\n\nA strong analogy is of course the laws of logic, not being formally \"laws\", but a system of rules or predicates that can be understood and justified in terms of a higher level (or \"theory\"), similar in some ways to the laws of physics. (Also, unlike the laws of physics, those in logic are not always directly provable by observation or experimentation - for example in logic, we don't generally have a formal proof of \"x is a sentence\", which is only true until proof-taking is performed, and then it becomes less true). Another way to think of logic is, rather, as a deductive method (although in the case of logic, a deductive method is by nature more complex and sophisticated than the natural deductive process that underlies a similar natural language method, which is more primitive in its fundamental laws - for example in logic, the notion of a conjunction is more fundamental than that of a negation, and may be used more to interpret evidence than to form a new hypothesis about the underlying universe). Note that the laws of logic are simply rules and methods that can be applied to make a prediction about a piece of evidence which follows the rules (and the rules are themselves based on certain higher-level logical axioms, such as that all logical propositions may only be true when they are both true and false, etc.).\n\nGeneral relativity describes gravity as the curvature of space-time, and the cosmological constant is essentially the \"dynamical constant\" of the field of physics (the theory of the \"Habersham Durchmusterung\" or \"Higgs field\"), with more mathematical precision than the field of physics, where the field of physics is usually defined by a \"natural number\" - this is known as \"the fundamental field\". For example, if we divide the fundamental field into its \"weak force\" and \"strong force\" components, one will see that we get the field of motion which, in terms of fundamental physics, has two fundamental components - the electromagnetic force, which is a fundamental component of electromagnetism, and the gravitational force, which is a fundamental component of gravitation.\n\nGeneral relativity describes gravity as \"cosmological constant\", which has little or no physical significance beyond the idea that \"cosmological constant\" is a valid mathematical mathematical name which includes, for example, some \"real numbers\" of some kind, and that we can treat them like any other numbers. This idea had become mainstream in modern physics, although many modern physicists doubt whether it is valid for real-world parameters, for example the values of the other parameters in relativity theory. This concept of the \"cosmological constant\" is also used to characterize other parameters in relativity such as the speed of light in spacetime, or to compare them (for example, in relativity theory, the speed of light, a parameter that affects both motion and gravity, is different from the speed of a galaxy [see also A Note on General Relativity's Speed of Galaxies).\n\nFor more details about the cosmological constant, see Cosmology of the Cosmos or the Cosmology Wikipedia article.", "label": 1, "id": 100093}

He has the same persona he had in \"\"Stuntman\",\" which is about the worst \"superhero\" ever produced. He can't actually dance and can't sing, but just tries to make up for it by being huge and musclebound and having all the same superpowers. The \"Big Show\" is just an imitation of Hulk Hogan, who is obviously a fan of these types over at the WWE. But Big Show doesn't even have the chops for that. This version of Big Show is just a big, weak weak guy who takes out anybody he can. When he does this it is always in a stupid comedy skit, like the \"The World Tour\". The episode does however have some real star power, with \"The Rock\" as his manager, \"Kanye West\" as his trainer and he does play a song by Michael Jackson (not the official music but a song from a Jackson songbook.)\n\n\nThe first 3 seasons of this show were basically a series of skits and sketches in which Big Show (I'm guessing) performs stunts and shows off his muscles. He then gets a coach (probably a retired professional wrestler?) who starts getting him into more legit wrestling moves. In a move that is typical of WWE programming of these days, he runs into \"The Beast\", who tries to stop him with all sorts of physical moves, but the Beast just tries to get him in a hold and Big Show just falls on a big metal table! It is actually kind of sad because I really like Big Show's character and I like seeing him work his way on to becoming a champion.\n\n\nThe Big Show in his big guy form in the first episode of the series.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in the second episode of the series. This sequence is one of the most exciting in the entire series and features so many great bits and ideas.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in his \"Tombstone\" theme song.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in his \"Curb\" theme song. The episode is very funny as the \"Big Show\" fights every villain with the utmost brutality and then gets beaten down by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage for some reason (Randy is actually pretty hot.) Finally he is brought down by \"Shawn Michaels\", who, among many other feats of strength is able to crush the \"Big Show\" in the middle of a ring with his bare hands.\n\n\nI really like the original ending that was scripted in so that the characters of the WWF could make any sort of comeback. The opening sequence with \"Shawn Michaels and Undertaker\" is great and I like that the two have a very violent battle in which Michaels manages to smash \"Shawn\" upside down into some kind of mat with one blow. \"Undertaker\" then proceeds to get on top of Michaels and is the one to go under the bottom rope into a tombstone and then get himself back to his feet. The end of this sequence shows the WWF wrestlers going at it in the ring and then the end credits to the theme song, which is awesome. (This is one of the only times that a WWF logo is shown after the end credits when they appear too quickly.)\n\n\nI really like how this show is not in an \"WWF style\" format and that is probably more true then you may think. The first season was mostly just a series of skits, sketches and music videos. The second season really tries to develop more plot lines and actually has a lot of character development. I think the producers were very happy with the ratings that show and wanted to try a new format.\n\n\nI think one of the best parts of the second season was it showing the wrestlers at the top of their game at the beginning of the series, and then some of them slowly dropping in ratings and going downhill. This was a great introduction for many fans and gives a real sense of how the WWF got to be who it is today. The second season was also edited in such a way that it showed Vince McMahon and the WWF trying to make money and make shows that are for sale for advertisers and if this were to occur again, we could expect \"Stuntman\", \"\"The Undertaker\",\"\" \"Randy Savage\" and others to be a part of the next season.\n\n\nIf you love the first season, then this show will probably be very enjoyable to you. At the same time you could easily watch it in spite and say that it is basically a garbage excuse for a wrestling show. The opening sequence and \"Dino Bravo\" are great and I think that the theme song, \"Curb\", is pretty good. Overall, this season was probably the best I've seen in a long time and I think that you need to watch this to see how this stuff worked behind the scenes of the WWF.\n\n\nIn Summary: \"The Big", "label": 1, "id": 100094}

{"text": "The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune of seeing is a film called \"Sausage Party.\"\n\nIt was released in theaters this past Friday, and I watched it to my parents' horrified grins.\n\nA comedy about a bunch of slackers on a mission to \"Sausage Game,\" the plot of the movie is pretty dull and predictable. But, I'm more interested in the characters in the movie than the plot is. One of the people I'd like to mention from the movie is Josh Hutcherson. For some reason, he's not part of the cast. So I'm going to fill you in on the backstory of the guy.\n\n\"Bunnicula\" \u2014 Josh's nickname among his friends and former classmates \u2014 was never really cool. He was more of a bully and a pain in the neck. He lived with his girlfriend, his mom, and an older sibling in a family of eight. As mentioned, he was bullied as a child. When the family moved, he was sad in a lot of ways. But being in the middle of high school with all these fresh hormones (and a girl named Megan) had made him feel pretty good. Also, he was super into music. So while his friends were in \"going on tour\" mode and hanging out in the parking lot and being mean, he went to every shows up until that point, usually wearing headphones to block out the bass.\n\nAnd then, one night, Josh went out to go clubbing. He was trying to go back to the dorm, but he got lost. He ended up at a bar that wasn't being used at the time and got lucky that they didn't shut it down immediately, because they weren't planning on taking students home that night. They were open up until close, so he was really into walking home. When he got home, he was going to walk home and there was nothing on his way. He started walking toward his truck and a homeless guy who said he needed someone to help him move out because he was moving out, and Josh said, \"I ain't moving!\" But then Josh realized, \"I'm a bum! I live in front of my house! I'm homeless.\" Suddenly he's in this situation that he normally wouldn't be in. As he's walking back on the street, he sees a police car pull up. He sees an officer with a gun on him and he realizes that the police are going to kill him. And now Josh is sitting in a car alone, with this dead man sitting next to him.\n\nThis leads to many flashbacks to the day that Josh saw \"Sausage Party.\" It's a cool ending but at the same time it has a lot of \"what the fuck\" moments.\n\nJosh doesn't really believe in ghosts. So when he opens up his truck and finds the dead body on his lawn, he thinks it's one more sign that the forces of evil are making him relive his death when he's still alive. He's not actually dead, not really. He just got drunk and made a mistake. So then, like some twisted version of a \"Shrek\" moment, the whole movie unfolds the way you expect it to.\n\nBut Josh is also the kind of person who is good at hiding and covering things up. He can't believe that he would be arrested or prosecuted for something so stupid. And so a few days later, he pulls a gun on the police officer who just arrested him for being drunk and acting like a jerk to other people. Josh says if he doesn't get out of the car, the officer will shoot him. The officer goes ahead and does so, then pulls out his own gun afterwards. Joshua says if the cop shoots him in the face, he would never get out of jail alive.\n\nJosh gets shot.\n\nSo that's kind of a crazy movie. It's a lot of fun until the end. And it also raises questions for people who have the misfortune of being so close to Josh and his friends. Does Josh really live in the same house as his mom and girlfriend and brother? And who the heck would be living with them and doing all of the weird stuff, and wouldn't it be weird to have four bros who are all hanging out all the time?\n\nAnyway, it's really really hilarious. It's also one of the most poorly written movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching.", "label": 1, "id": 100097}
{"text": "hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized inflammation of the linings of the heart and lungs. In most cases, pachymeningitis develops slowly and is followed by shortness of breath, but it may cause death if you are predisposed to heart and pulmonary disease, if you have had recent infections, if you have underlying conditions that could trigger the disease such as obesity or smoking, or if you have a heart valve or other valve disease. People with heart valve disease, diabetes, or other severe cardiovascular diseases, should be particularly careful to avoid the risk of pachymeningitis. Pachymeningitis is generally diagnosed by auscultation or needle biopsy when evidence of inflammation of the linings of the heart and lungs is seen. Pachymeningitis is treated by the administration of inhaled steroids to reduce the inflammation and a course of therapy consisting of immunosuppressive medications to control inflammation of the lungs as well as medications to reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\nComplications of Pachymeningitis One of the most common complications of pachymeningitis is the risk of heart disease. In some patients, a pulmonary embolus causes prolonged pachymeningitis and in other cases, an infection causes rupture and infection of the valves or other parts of the lung. Severe pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening if a patient develops a significant infarction or rupture of heart valves (perforation) or of the pulmonary veins.\n\nPrevention of Pachymeningitis Preventing pachymeningitis should be one of the chief goals of a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Participants were classified according to serum 25(OH)D concentration, and dichotomous vitamin D status was defined by the lowest 25(OH)D concentration (45\u201375 nmol/L) in the analysis of serum 25(OH)D as the cut-off, based on previous literature [ 22 ].\n\nThe Medical Research Council (MRC) Biobank is funded by the Medical Research Council. We identified participants from data sets included in previous papers in the British population, with a similar age range of 17 to 79 years (average age 61). Blood was drawn from the tail vein on a fingerstick at the completion of the baseline examination, and serum was extracted and quantified with the use of a biochemical method (Quantitative Mass Spectrometry) and a validated method (25(OH)D assay). After extraction and quantification, 50 mg was divided into 2 plasma measurements and stored at \u221270\u00b0C until used for the study.\n\nParticipants were assessed using the Edinburgh Sleep Quality Index (ESQI) [ 20 ] and their fasting blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) levels were taken. An index for insulin resistance was used, as recommended by some studies [ 8, 14, 21 ]. At baseline, an insulin tolerance test was performed, which used the Zimbra insulin clamp (Monark Diagnostics, Oxford, England; model 810R; ZEUS) to measure insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in healthy non-diabetic subjects.\n\nA random sample of the 1000 participants was selected to undergo the cross-over study. From that subset, 50 participants were randomly assigned to DRI and 50 participants to control group. For the DRI group, the study consisted of weekly dietary advice to achieve a 25(OH)D concentration of 40 ng/ml at baseline (5 mg/day), a daily dose of 800 IU vitamin D 2 /d via a vitamin D supplement (Vegka, Merck and Co Ltd, USA) for 3\u201310 d before sampling (6 d) and then 1.5 mg/day vitamin D 3 /day (DRI group) or 0 mg/day vitamin D 3 /day (control group) for the next 7 d (6 d + 1 g) [ 14 ]. Following the DRI intervention, participants in the control group continued to receive their regular supplementation. After the second 10-d washout period, the participants in the DRI group were assigned to either DRI + calcium or control + calcium, and all other participants were reassessed 5 wk later, when they were on a calcium-supplementated diet. The DRI group received 3.75\u20135.75 mg vitamin D/d (calcium plus vitamin D 3 /d), whereas the control group received 1.15\u20131.65 mg vitamin D 2/d. The usual calcium supplementation regimen was not given during the study period, and blood samples were taken for measurement of calcium excretion. Participants in the control group continued their normal oral calcium supplement and were free to take vitamin D 3 supplements to treat their vitamin D deficiency. Detailed information regarding compliance was not available, although the usual calcium supplementation regimen was not given. All participants were contacted for regular blood counts, and no participants had any clinical signs or manifestations of bone disease (e.g., osteoporosis, osteopenia) during the study [ 14 ]. Participants in the control group continued to receive their usual oral calcium and multivitamins at the completion of the study. All participants completed a dietary history questionnaire and returned a written informed consent prior to participation. No participant withdrew from the clinical trial due to ethical reasons.\n\nThe protocol was approved by the Ethics Subcommittee of the Royal College of Physicians and Health Scientists (MRC Biobank, London, UK). All participants gave their written informed consent before being consented and completed a dietary history questionnaire, with a detailed assessment of food intake and serum 25(OH)D levels, when available.\n\nDRI participants experienced a significant increase in the bioavailable fraction of the vitamin D metabolites 25(OH)D and calcitriol over the course of the trial (see ). The relative increase for urinary vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol + 25(OH)D 1.04 ng/ml + 2.06 ng/ml + 1.18 ng/ml) was greater in the DRI group compared with the control group (P = 0.01).

{"text": "although the national health service ( nhs ) is regarded as a \"laboratory\" for assessing the effectiveness of the NHS, it has never been officially designated a \"clinical research center\" for clinical practice. Clinical research centers are subject to several federal requirements regarding funding and accreditation. There are 13 such centers located in the United States, including 3 in California and 1 in Texas. The NIH Center for Clinical Research in Primary Care (CCPRC) is the major federal center for conducting clinical trials and evaluating potential therapeutic approaches.\n\nThe CCPRC was formally established in 1983; its first study was the National Primary Care Study ( NPL ) of patients with hypertension [ 26 ]. CCPRC researchers initiated the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) survey to assess general health conditions and prevent-ability in 2003. For this survey, CCPRC investigators recruited a total of 38,400 adult participants via the website of the U.S. Army Nutrition Research Institute ( ARIN ) and the National Epidemiologic Survey, on which the study data were based. Participants were interviewed to receive the information about their health conditions. On their way to the interview, survey takers collected demographic data and medical and demographic questionnaire, which included the question about smoking status. On their return, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire about their health conditions. The questionnaire asked about the frequency of self-reported adverse health conditions, the prevalence of those conditions, symptoms, treatments, and comorbidities. For other important information such as diagnosis of coronary disease, participants were asked to provide additional information related to whether coronary disease was a diagnosed medical condition (e.g., whether coronary artery disease had been diagnosed), with the option of providing a statement of self-reported status or a medical diagnosis. In addition, as a component of these self-reported responses, participants were invited to provide information about the treatment of their health condition. The survey also asked whether participants had been treated in a specialty clinic in the previous year and, if so, the size of that clinic. If they stated that they had not, the surveytakers were able to locate the clinic through the telephone directory and contact the doctor or other health care worker responsible for the diagnosis.\n\nAs of March 1, 2003, NCRR, with its principal goal of evaluating treatments for depression and anxiety, enrolled 18,879 participants. Participants were recruited from 12 sites throughout the United States and administered a computer-delivered questionnaire to assess their depression and anxiety and to answer questions about personal history and other important aspects of their lives (i.e., employment, family, community). During the baseline phase of the study, 5,300 participants provided more complete responses on all of the major depression and anxiety questions. Of these, 4,062 completed the final evaluation and were enrolled as full participants, the 5,300 remaining participants completing the baseline phase were considered the study sample. Data were used to evaluate the efficacy of nine treatment modalities: cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, brief interpersonal therapy, antidepressant medications, placebo medications, combined mood stabilizer/antidepressant medications, psychodysleptic medications, anxiety-control strategies, and yoga and prayer.\n\nDuring its 10-year history, the CCRC has supported more than 130 publications. A few of these publications are described below:\n\nWe recently conducted a retrospective electronic search of published research reports written about CCRC and specifically the most recent 9-month period, 1996\u20131999, using MEDLINE and the PsychINFO system's \"Search\" facility (http://www.psychinfo.org/). We retrieved 33 reports, covering 2,208 participants. The majority of these reports were by researchers working at the CCRC and many were written by other researchers outside of CCRC. Three of these reports described the CCRC's clinical trial programs and were conducted at the other two research centers that were funded by the CCRC. One report described the effect of CCRC's Clinical Treatment Evaluation Program (CTEP) on individuals with cancer at the other two research centers that received CCRC support. In addition, five of the reports presented research published in CCRC's peer-reviewed journals, including one that had been initially accepted with the title \"Treatment Programs for Depression and Anxiety\" [ 24 ]. Nine other reports were published in the journals of major journals for research into health issues and included one report showing the superiority of CCRC's cognitive behavioral therapy to standard neuroleptic medication in reducing the rates of relapse in patients with depression [ 26 ].\n\nA total of 619 participants were recruited in 1998 or 1999 as the first phase of this study. From this initial group, an additional 14,013 were randomized to 6 different treatments, to determine the effects of the various treatments on psychological distress and clinical outcomes.

I've always been interested in politics, but not in the business-style parties. We're talking about the future of the European continent. We must create an environment where countries can collaborate and come together. Europe will always change, because Europe's core is going to evolve, but the main issues will not change. The values will stay the same. So I would like to be the prime minister of a positive European agenda, where we can find common ground, work together, and create an integrated European Union and a European federalist strategy.\"\n\nBack in Hoekstra's office, his son Dirk is working on some of his projects, including the reassembly of his father's old wooden boat \u2014 the \"Sparta II,\" to keep it rust-free as he ages.

He is a hardass and it's driving him mad.\" As we talk, my feet get warm and my hands start to sweat. I want to tell Hoekstra I'm not sweating so much now, but don't. I have a great responsibility.

If the particle is not in contact with its environment ( i.e., the diffusion constant \u03b5 = 3.85\u00d710\u22124 m2/s) then there is no convective transport. If the interaction energy between the two particles, which is given by the kinetic energy of the particles (E K ) is less than the effective thermal energy at the point of contact with the gas (k 1 / 2E), then the particles must be bound. For a gas, it can be shown that the effective thermal energy and the effective kinetic energy must always be conserved by local adiabatic compression. The partial differential equation has some good properties for a particular type of fluid in which there is no thermal enthalpy on the particles. However, its properties can also be improved by including the effective enthalpy on the particles (2). This has been done successfully in the thermodynamic studies of the transition from gas to vapor and of the thermal diffusion and absorption of particles in the gas phase.

{"text": "Wow! I picked this off the rental shelf because I was told it was very expensive. It is on the pricier side to get in for the month, but the great part is it has a small but well lit bed and a comfortable chair. The mattress is a little stiff but I'm sure a nice little mattress and a soft reclining chair will make the experience much better. I think what was wrong with my first rental was that the bedroom was in a bad part of the house. The landlord said they did not have one small bedroom in the house, so the bedroom in this house is smaller than it should be at just over 5ft wide and 6ft deep. The carpet is great in general and the bedding is nice and comfy.\n\nThe biggest negative I will say about this place is that the water line is just about a foot above the ceiling and I had to take a hammer and chisel to it when the electrician came through to fix the bathroom wall last week. I have not had a chance to inspect the plumbing yet, but I expect it to be very bad.\n\nI am very impressed by the place. I am a new tenant and it is very well furnished. The place is so clean that I am looking for a bigger place with the same amount of space. The landlord is very easy going and it seems like everything has been kept up very well except for the water line issue. We all are so far on time with all our appointments. This was my first apartment and this was my first real hassle. I just hope everything goes smoothly with the sewer work so we avoid having to deal with the water line issue that comes up from time to time.\n\nI moved to South Pasadena last week and had to wait awhile before my landlord signed me in and gave me our key. Since i did not stay anywhere for a long period of time I ended up staying there for about 1 weekend. I didn't appreciate it until the next morning when I decided to go in for a shower. It took me 15 to 20 minutes to get to the bathroom which was directly in front of us. I could hear my shower running and when I got in it seemed like no water was coming out. I would have walked a block or 2 and it would have cleared out. On a previous visit at 30th and Los Robles I had to walk a block or two past it. Then a week ago it was still there. When I called my landlord today to ask for an address so I could get my key he told me that the area around the kitchen where nobody lives is considered a 'public lot area'. So they will take care of the water lines. No problem! When we had breakfast there yesterday we were surprised at how nice it all looked. All in all we just thought the bathrooms were kinda dirty and some walls were cracked. I would say it was pretty decent of a new place if you don't have to wait quite as long to get a key.\n\nMy old place, my home. Home of my greatest fear, the dark dark of my soul. I would like to thank everyone who came out and joined me. Thank you to the people in the street, thank you to the neighbors who were so nice. I got to meet my first real LA neighbors and see the view from my door. Most importantly the house is filled with beautiful memories of my childhood, the good, the bad and the ugly. My little home. It has been my home for 10 years now. It's about time I got to share my own home with all the other wonderful people that visit here. With that said, you deserve a little bit more love. I was happy to have my door pried, my garbage picked up, my pool cleaned up, my bed was made, the shower was made and my windows have been cleaned. It has also been decided to bring back the trash cans but on the outside of the building. Just not next door. All in all, everything was wonderful, just as I could have ever hoped and then some.\n\nGreat place to rent a place! The apartment was clean and a lot of the items were well maintained. I had a great time in there.\n\nWe have had it for about 8 months as a month to month lease. Since then, the building has been completely remodeled by our local builder. Everything has been done but unfortunately the new unit is too far off the street in front of us. The new unit overlooks the street and has a huge window like ours, however, it also requires you to share two bathrooms with a roommate, and at this rate, we won't be able to do that. A lot of the apartment is done up in a much nicer way than ours, but it's not a great deal at this rate. If you don't mind sharing or don't mind the $1/tank maintenance fee, this place is a great choice. Otherwise, it's not worth the hassle and that's the reason we're giving it one star", "label": 1, "id": 100109}

{"text": "a general method for compressing the modulation time - bandwidth or phase can be calculated very accurately so that in the event of an error, no extra information is lost (unless the error is large, which is unlikely).\n\nThe above method of generating the phase-coherent frequency, given the time-invariant phase and frequency, is a general method. It can be used for all sorts of purposes such as generating audio signals with time-domain phase and frequency modulation (eg. audio signal generators, digital audio converters etc), for digital control of an AM radio receiver or other digital radio equipment, or for generating time-division-synchronous (DDS) audio signals.\n\nNote:- If the phase of our modulation source and our frequency source are the same, the phase error can never exceed the frequency error by some small amount, and the ratio of the two errors is called the phase shift error. There are also general methods for solving various types of phase errors, for some of which it can be useful to consult a reference such as O'Malley.\n\nIn practice, the phase error becomes larger with longer times for the time domain phase but smaller for the frequency domain phase so any large phase errors will result in either the modulation being degraded or the other end of the chain not being able to provide proper modulation. This can be shown in the following plot:\n\nHere is an example. We have two audio signals which are perfectly well balanced for one frequency but are clearly distorted (left) and we measure the phase error in the frequency domain with a sinusoid. We then multiply this sinusoid with the other frequency before applying a gain to achieve a level to which no external distortion can introduce.\n\nThere are two key observations:\n\nAt both frequencies, the phase error is positive (and not zero) at about 1 kHz. We get a positive phase shift difference when the period of the sinusoid is longer. This means that the phase error in the period domain will rise as the time for the sinusoid's period doubles. The positive time domain phase error will not be as large as the frequency (negative phase offset error).\n\nThe positive phase offset error shows up as 'cross-talk' between the modulation and the other end. The negative phase offset error is not visible, which may be because some internal distortion could be doing most of it.\n\nOne way to reduce negative phase offset error in the time domain is to add a sinusoidal signal with very large frequency that crosses over between the two channels.\n\nIn the above plot (in stereo to make the horizontal scale and right-angled so it shows both channels), you can see the sinusoidal signal is crossed over between the left and middle channels. The source can have many harmonics with a time domain frequency, and each is an error in harmonics of the phase error. When these harmonics cancel, so that you add up their effects, you end up with a much nicer error with smaller phase error.\n\nThe above plot shows the phase error in the frequency domain (the left side) was reduced by 3.0 dB when a sinusoid with a frequency of around 120 Hz crossed over at around 3 kHz.\n\nThere is a lot of interesting mathematical theory behind this diagram with lots you can do with it. If you want to look more in depth, here is a website that has all sorts of formulas and some good references for working with phase and frequency.\n\nNow we can understand how to apply a sinusoid here. The sinusoid will have the same frequency (the frequency of the sinusoid), phase, and phase offset but will be a phase shifter. The idea of a sinusoid is to phase shift the phase of the signal from one frequency to another (a modulation signal if you will). The original signal remains the same but the time domain phase is shifted so that it is always between 0 and +1 (plus or minus) depending on the phase to which it is shifted by half the phase of the source. So we can think of this as the phase shifting a series of sine waves into a harmonic waveform.\n\nIf you multiply a wave by a sinusoid, you are also multiplying the sinusoid which is multiplied by the current time step you are using and that can only be positive time steps, so you end up with a sinusoid that is positive for all current time steps, not just half the time steps.\n\nWe start out with a sinusoidal frequency of 6 Hz and we multiply it by a sinusoid frequency of 360 degrees (which becomes 1 Hz) and we multiply that that same sinusoid frequency by a sinusoid frequency of 360 degrees. We can get a sinusoidal frequency of 12.5 Hz if we double that value, but note that this is not the same frequency as that of each of the 1 Hz x 360 degrees sinus", "label": 1, "id": 100111}

He said it was for voters to decide the UK's exit from the bloc but said the government \"will remain committed\" to leaving the customs union at the same time.\n\nThe announcement came as business groups said the Brexit vote had cost the UK economy up to \u00a3250bn a year.\n\nMore than a million people took part in the rally in central London, as more than 100 Downing Street protesters carried banners which read: \"Leave the EU we don't want a border between us and Europe\".\n\nIn a separate event on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, called for a \"bold Brexit\", saying: \"For me this is not about the specifics of the relationship with the EU but about the long-term viability of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nMr Johnson, who has been among the most pro-leave members of the cabinet, said his dream Brexit was a \"jobs-first\" deal, in which the UK retains ties with Europe but does as much trade as possible with the world.\n\nOn immigration, he added: \"We should take an opportunity to create the right conditions for businesses in our cities and towns, and for young people from all parts of the EU, by cutting net migration to the tens of thousands.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he would also advocate for a referendum on whether the UK should stay in the single market - the EU's largest export market.\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was accused by Labour of taking people for \"marionettes\" or puppets when he said he still hoped for a no deal deal scenario.\n\nDuring his speech in Florence, Mr Cameron told MEPs he wanted \"the best possible deal for Britain", "label": 1, "id": 100113}

And the closest thing to playing was like what we found in Southern California.\n\nIn some ways growing up in the U.S., in the suburbs of California in a different household\u2014it's much different to go out in the neighborhood and play football, I mean, what can you say? You've got to use your legs or you're a kid. That's really the only thing you can say. I don't know if your mom was a coach, but I just had to have my legs and my head and work for everything. Then, later on, I'm playing at this position called fullback, you've got to use both feet. It's just different. But yeah, I still had to work for my stuff, no question about it.\n\nSo, when you started to start going to high school in the U.S., what was that like for you?\n\nThat's where my love for college football started. We didn't necessarily go to a different school, it's kind of where we found out that we actually liked college football. So I started to study and play a whole lot, but you know, at the same time as you study and you play, you know, I was studying too, because I wanted to be the best I could possibly be at all times. I knew I didn't know everything, I knew how to do this, I knew how to do that, I knew a lot, but you know, I kept my finger on the pulse. And so I kept going to different places to learn different stuff, going to Alabama when they played Southern Miss and things like that. And I didn't really play in college the first time, I didn't play for three years because I was like, \"I can't even do it.\" And then I started to go back to college every spring, and I think I took another year off to go back and play [at Georgia\u2014Ed.]. I played with an injury and an Achilles rupture after my junior year, but the Achilles worked well enough and it made me stronger than I was beforehand. So I went back to Georgia, and then the next year I went back to college for my senior year and they gave me a full scholarship.\n\nI didn't have that one year off, and so as a senior, I played against Florida, Georgia Tech, South Carolina, Notre Dame, I played against all of them. I thought I had a pretty good season, but then I got hurt and I kind of sat out. I went to practice, but then I played, I played very good for two years, but then, once the Achilles tear happened, my football career kind of came to an end. As a result of the Achilles tear, my career was over. But my love for college football, I'm still at it. So, I'm still playing and I'm still at it, and it's still one of the biggest things in my life right now. So it's very rewarding to do.", "label": 1, "id": 100116}

{"text": "Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific properties include Turing's 1955 problem of finding the shortest path between two points, and the 1973 problem of how to find a set of consecutive permutations of an element. Both are based on solving tasks where most decisions would be based on the existing knowledge of a set of characters. The only difference here is that this time, the system is a computer that knows the answers to the problems you are given, it has just no memory of the actual tasks you are asked to perform.\n\nThis is the sort of problem that computers are better at, as they do the computations more efficiently and are better at generalising in real environments, i.e. they can find solutions to problems of a general size to which they can be generalised to (Tuesdays talk).\n\nThe problem of getting a computer to do things a human cannot without the aid of a human can, of course, be solved. Turing's 1952 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" (Tuesdays talk) proved how to reduce the problem of programming a general purpose computer to a small set of problems that humans can efficiently solve. Today, many of the problems solved in programming have been solved using techniques like recursion, which involve building recursively large sub-problems as their solution, and are still used by many programming languages.\n\nTuring's argument, in these two papers, was that it would be possible to program a computer that could be both more intelligent (since the machine would retain its knowledge of other tasks) without reducing it to a human, and yet could store less information. Using a set of simple problem solving techniques that a human could easily grasp, and which would probably also allow a computer to learn and reason (as Turing and Leijonhuis both noted), one can build a computer that can learn in much the same way that our own human brains do. This idea is now known as \"deep memory\", and we have found it is useful to understand how this works.\n\nSome of the ideas first proposed by Turing\n\nThe work of Alan Turing in developing the practical computer is often cited most often by those who reject his ideas. Turing proposed the Turing Machine as a tool for building such a machine, and it was used to solve a number of problems. Turing was also involved in the development of quantum computing, which requires that the computer has no memory of its past activities at all (this is similar to what we are trying to develop, i.e. a computer capable of having no memories about any tasks it has already completed).\n\nFor decades, people working on artificial general intelligence (AGI) have been trying to understand what is required to make a machine that can solve any problem a human can solve, with no additional information or memory required to solve those problems. And there have been a number of different approaches considered. Many different kinds of systems have been proposed, and no single approach has been widely accepted.\n\nThe Turing Machine, which is a computer that has no memory, is said to be the best known of these approaches (for example, see the paper \"Computer programs that can learn\" by Tom Mitchell and Andrew Brown). These systems also have no \"thinking\" element\u2014they are only just approximations (we are building up from a state of a machine to some output), but still, they are thought to be much more useful than human-built systems\u2014they are better at carrying out mathematical calculations, they have \"unlimited\" memory, and they can be combined with other system to solve tasks in more complicated situations.\n\nThe key idea in many of these systems is called \"recursive self-improvement\". These \"recursive\" systems work by making small improvements, each time asking a new question, which often leads to a new state. But the question is not \"tell me how you are doing well now\". Rather, the question is to \"what is the best way you can improve, on the current state, to get closer to the best you can be?\"\n\nThis process involves \"obtaining a large body of practical knowledge about the problem to be solved\". This is often described as \"programming in advance\". Some systems just work with known quantities, such as the size of the problem and how to get it done. Others need to know enough to perform the computation in a way that is \"efficient\", but not so much that the computation itself takes forever. Still many of them make their progress in a step-by-step, and \"explain in detail the whole course of action that the computer has to follow.\"\n\nMost of these systems also have a \"logistic function\", a function that gives some probability distribution over all possible solutions to the problem. This \"logistic function\" is a very simple, and very powerful, concept.\n\nTuring's original ideas\n\nIn order to understand Turing's ideas of how to represent a human's intelligence", "label": 1, "id": 100120}
{"text": "the continuous - time quantum monte carlo method is applied as a direct method of measuring the position and momentum of a particle. This method is based on the principle of a closed-loop system in which the system includes the measurement element (measurement unit) and the particle. Each measurement process is isolated and linked to the measurement unit so as to be identical.\n\nThe single particle position is found by using the momentum measurement (measurement unit) to determine the momentum of the particle and the unitary motion of the particle. This principle is useful for determining the particle's trajectory from the position. The particle momentum is used in the process to measure the particle's position. This method is a complete process with respect to particles, measurement elements, and the measurements in a measurement unit. If the measurement system is a particle which, by applying an external force, is repelled by an external reference point, the position and momentum of the particle are determined by the action of the external force upon the particle. There are other methods of determining the position and velocity of particles and all other aspects of these processes are discussed under the general aspects of measurements. The methods are separated into two distinct groups as follows: Direct methods (A: E) Single particle position and momentum measurement methods (C:D)\n\nA:E. A:E methods. The fundamental result of the single particle position and momentum measurement methods is the equation\n\nwhere m and g are the momenta of single particles respectively. Another more concise equation which represents the principle of a measurement in the present state of the art (including the application of the principles of quantum mechanics and of relativity) is\n\n(15)\n\nThe measurement system includes an external target (the measurement unit). As the system approaches the target the speed of the system is increased to achieve the measurement. If the speed is limited by the target's speed, the speed of the measurement to the target can be expressed as the time integral of the position of the measurement unit from the target. The external force used to overcome the target (the external reference point) is expressed by a constant force F. The value of F for a given system is determined by the interaction between the applied force and the target. The force F for a given acceleration R is given in Equation (18) where R is the acceleration in units of time. The unit of F is the foot-pound (lb) unit or the centimeter-second (cm) unit. As noted above, a unit of time is always in units of hours (h). These terms are used to convert from degrees to radians or vice versa. In units of radians the force and position of the system are specified in terms of x, y, and z coordinates. The coordinates are defined in such a way that\n\n(16)\n\nA:E. A:E methods. The principle of a measurement in the present state of the art can be developed so as to solve any equation relating the position and momentum of the unit to that of the external target. If the external target is an arbitrary reference, the solution to the equations for the velocity and position of the unit are derived by the procedure described in (A) above. If the external target is a known target, the solution to the equations for the position are given by the method of linear algebra described in Equation (1). Thus, all of the applications of the single particle position and momentum measurement methods listed in Table 1 can be explained by the principles of position and momentum measurement for a position and momentum measurement system containing an external target. The complete result of the single particle position and momentum measurement for a position and momentum measurement system containing an external target is stated in Table 3. This table does not refer to the specific position and momentum measurement method or the particular unit of measurement. Instead, it gives the relationship between the position and velocity of the particle of mass m, the momentum of the particle, and the external force F F used to overcome the external reference point. Thus, this table gives the form of equations necessary to solve an equation relating the magnitude of the position of the measurement unit, the size and position of the external target, and the value of the external force F F to be used to overcome the external target. The solutions to all such equations are obtained by directly integrating the time derivative of the position of the measurement unit. This is another way to develop the principle of position and momentum measurement. Note that Equation (5), (6), (7) and (8) should be read together. The equation\n\n(17)\n\nstates that any system with a certain value of F and a certain external target velocity and position may be written as (18)\n\n(19)\n\nThus, the position of the particle in one measurement unit of time t is equal to the velocity of the particle at t in a measurement unit of time t' corresponding to the external force F, as follows.

{"text": "As of the 2010 United States Census, southern California has about 7.7 million people, not including areas outside of city limits. So by comparing the 2010 census to 2008, it seems as if our population has increased by more than a million people in four years (and is now just shy of 7.7 million).\n\nOn average, the population of all three areas in 2010 was 8.2 percent higher than the population of the California population overall (including out-of-state residents) that year. As with most areas of the country, though, the population of cities outside of Los Angeles and San Diego increased more slowly \u2014 in 2010, the city of Riverside had the population 8.6 percentage points higher than the state as a whole, while the state as a whole had a population 8.0 percentage points higher than Riverside.\n\nHow does Los Angeles compare to other big cities in the U.S.? It ranks eighth in population across the U.S., according to the 2013 American Community Survey. But as with any comparison, we don't have any idea what these numbers would look like today, given the growth that California saw from 2000 to 2010.\n\nThe most notable factor in our population growth is international immigration. California's population grew 3.7 percent in 2010 over the previous decade \u2014 from about 6.6 million to 7.2 million.\n\nAbout half of the growth in our population came from non-citizen legal immigrants; this is less than half the 4.2 percent growth seen nationally, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nAmong the foreign-born residents came mainly from India, with about 3 million in the state, followed by China and Mexico.\n\nIn 2010, the top five countries of origin for Californians living in the state were India (2.0 million), China, Mexico, Philippines and the Philippines (1.3 million each). By comparison, about 600,000 Californians lived in the Philippines.\n\nAs you might expect, our native-born population also grew more slowly over the past decade. Since 2000, native-born Californians have increased about 3.1 percent, while immigrants grew 3.4 percent.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. Immigrants aren't all from Asia. About half are from Europe and Canada. The remaining immigrant group comes from elsewhere.\n\nCalifornia's foreign-born population may also reflect the fact that some U.S.-born residents who moved elsewhere, such as retirees, left the state but stayed in their parents' home state, perhaps as California residents. Immigrants in their late 20s or early 30s also might be counted in the foreign-born population of someone who moved to another state but returned home to California.\n\nWhat is clear is that California's increasing population is also changing the state's overall political makeup in many areas. About half the state's population is minorities, as one would expect from a state that has a large Latino population. The share of Californians who are white stayed about the same, and the nation as a whole was roughly the same. Blacks, who accounted for just 8.2 percent of California's population in 2000, made up 26.4 percent in 2010. And Asians, who make up 7.1 percent of Los Angeles County's population, accounted for 12.7 percent, up from 10.9 percent in 2000.\n\nOur state's population could grow more slowly or faster than other places in the country. We have fewer native-born Americans because so many native-born Americans leave the state. We have more newcomers because we have more international immigrants \u2014 many of them from China, India and other Asian countries.\n\nWe don't yet know what the California trend will be for the next decade. We do know, given what we already observe, that this is happening in our state \u2014 that there's always going to be more growth, and that it will be happening on a region-wide basis.\n\nFor more stats on the California population and demographics, head over to the Pew Research Center's latest report on the state of California.\n\n\u2022 Email: bkalinowski@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @briankalinowski", "label": 1, "id": 100126}

The flowers of this species are generally small and produced from an umbel that are about three to six millimetres long and with a long and narrow stem. The seeds of this species are large and round. The spongy fruits of this species are black and the leaves are dark green, sometimes tinged with pink. They are about 5 to 7 cm in diameter, with a thick upper surface that is covered with a very thin rachis. The seeds of D. acacia are very similar to those of the species known as Villosa, but are larger (up to 30 to 35 mm across) and more elliptical. The foliage of the D. acacia is short (up to 2,5 cm long) but the inflorescences are also short and are generally covered with spiky spines.

{"text": "concurrence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) with autoimmune hepatitis.1 It is also worth noting, since alcohol-induced hepatitis is the most serious adverse reaction observed in alcoholic patients, in clinical studies, in which alcohol and alcohol use were controlled adequately, alcohol and alcohol use were reported to be associated with less of a risk for other liver damage than was in studies in which alcohol use and alcohol use were uncontrolled, as described previously.1 These observations have been confirmed in multiple controlled studies in which alcohol, alcohol intake, and consumption of alcohol and alcohol use were controlled to various degrees, with similar negative results that confirm the adverse effects or potential adverse effects associated with excessive heavy drinking including liver damage, as outlined previously.1\n\nThe relationship between alcohol and liver damage in alcoholic men is not well established since alcoholism is considered to be more prevalent in men than women.2 In fact, although more women are diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) than men with this problem, men are diagnosed with nash more often than women are.2\n\nIn alcoholics, alcohol can cause fibrosis of the liver as well as liver cells in the liver to die. Liver fibrosis is a type of cirrhosis because the fatty tissues of the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The most common types of fibrosis in alcoholic cirrhosis are cirrhosis-causing bile ducts, which typically occurs at around 20% of fibrosis cases, and cirrhosis-causing gallbladder. Liver cirrhosis is more common in the extreme alcoholic population\u2014a combination of alcohol abuse and alcohol and drug abuse\u2014because moderate alcohol abuse is not necessarily sufficient to produce alcoholic liver injury.2,3\n\nHepatitis is a very common liver and related chronic disease that mainly affects the liver. Although alcoholic hepatitis is usually thought to be a chronic liver disease, in fact, if symptoms such as fever, hepatitis and jaundice are present, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose the underlying disease pathophysiology. Moreover, patients with hepatitis who undergo liver resection are less likely to develop full recovery than patients without hepatitis, although it is known that in the majority of patients, hepatitis is fully treated.2,3\n\nIn general, the body's immune system attacks the liver by releasing chemicals that cause damage to liver cells. The severity of the liver damage depends upon the inflammatory response of the liver. Therefore, chronic inflammation is usually associated with milder and less severe liver lesions. Alcohol itself does not cause inflammation, but its excess use stimulates the immune system to create excessive levels of the inflammation-causing substance.2\n\nThe liver was once regarded as a self-cleansing organ, but as the amount of alcohol used by the average person continues to rise to the point that liver fibrosis is more common, so does the potential for alcohol-induced damage to the liver.2,3 The chronic inflammation caused by alcohol also makes alcoholics more susceptible to other chronic disorders, such as the development of cancer.2 In fact, the majority of people who develop hepatitis do so within the first 10 years of becoming an alcoholic.3,4 It is difficult to say how much of the increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma\u2014the most common type of liver cancer\u2014comprises the increased incidence of chronic hepatitis that could be related to alcohol-related liver damage, but if the incidence of liver cancer continues to rise with rising alcohol consumption, as is the case in the United States, the increasing popularity of the beverage might contribute further to the increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.3\n\nAcetaminophen is the active ingredient that is used for pain relief that is reported to cause liver injury in some people. Acetaminophen exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activities.1 When acetaminophen is consumed in excess the body produces more and more of these substances, thereby forming acetaminophen-associated hepatotoxicity ( AHAH ), resulting in alcohol-induced damage in the liver. Acetaminophen overdoses that cause alcohol-induced liver failure have been reported in 3 US case reports and in multiple hospitalizations in which acetaminophen poisoning was the cause of death.1 According to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, acetaminophen toxicity can be dangerous if taken by people who are not taking other anti-inflammatory medications.3,4\n\nBecause of the increased risk of liver injury in chronic drinkers, studies in which alcohol was controlled, the alcohol-dependent subjects were monitored closely and all medications and medical medications were stopped, and measures were taken to determine whether or not the patients had liver damage, had undergone liver transplantation, or demonstrated evidence of hepatitis.2,3 One case study reported that those patients who consumed alcohol more than 2 g or more per day had a two-fold increase in the risk of receiving a liver transplant within one year of having acetaminophen poisoning.2 It is possible that liver disease", "label": 1, "id": 100132}
{"text": "As Tony Abbott said ad nauseam during the campaign, the Coalition will spend $50 billion on education and the rest on health, welfare and infrastructure.\n\nAs we have seen this year in government, that is not all that's planned for spending, as the Coalition released a detailed plan this morning to pay for the cost of its education and health policies.\n\nThe plan, with its mix of tax hikes and spending cuts, says the Coalition will have saved the budget $36 billion by 2015-16, \"with no additional tax increases\" and \"without significant welfare or health spending cuts\". If that is true, Australia's debt and deficit should both increase to $250 billion in 2015-16, instead of the $125 billion we've been seeing so far.\n\nSo where do we get the other $50 billion from? We begin the answer to that question with another question: Do the Coalition's plans add up? There is not a lot of evidence to support them and, even if they did, that would not explain where the savings are coming from.\n\nThe Budget Papers reveal there is only one tax the Coalition hasn't said will be abolished: the 3 per cent Medicare levy. \"We will get rid of that,\" Mr Pyne said Thursday of the current 3 per cent Medicare levy, which Labor argues must be scrapped. It is a charge the Coalition can't really say it's cutting, since it hasn't even mentioned it when it is considering its spending targets.\n\nThe Coalition's \"savings\" are not even all tax. A further $17.4 billion is to be found in savings from an array of measures proposed for universities, but not yet determined. The Coalition also plans to slash funding for the Australian Commission of Audit, and use the savings from that to reduce the funding of the Australian Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe government still plans an extra $6 billion in funding for the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance. It would be difficult for the government to reduce support for the tax-monitoring organisation while also reducing spending on other issues. If the government was saving money on \"social services\", it wouldn't have the money to pay for an extra AATC commissioner.\n\nThe budget papers indicate that the plan to eliminate the third of the four base-schools levy is more to do with revenue than \"savings\". Instead of eliminating the school levy and shifting the revenue to higher education, the budget paper proposes that \"a funding arrangement\" be worked out to \"avoid a return to the base-school structure\". It doesn't say what such an arrangement may be.\n\nNo plan for tax minimisation: Treasurer Read more\n\nWhat is clear is that a substantial amount of the savings to be found from the Coalition's various spending plans will be made without affecting other areas of the budget. The budget papers show $33.5 billion is saved from the tax break for business income. That is money that would come from reducing corporation tax, but it also has no affect on other spending priorities, from healthcare to education. Meanwhile, many of the $11 billion in savings for families from abolishing the second income tax bracket are already locked in as a result of changes the Abbott government made to marginal tax rates back in 2009.\n\nIn the context of a government that seems to be running in on spending every budget announcement it makes, it is not clear why the government would insist so adamantly that the cuts in its education and health measures will add to the economy. The budget papers indicate that there are no planned increases to pension, family support or the hospital dividend. The only \"savings\" mentioned are $10 billion to spend on improving the infrastructure. That's not savings but merely \"investments\" and neither are they the kind that have been made by previous governments. That's because these are only \"priority investments\" \u2013 those which are needed to \"address shortfalls in infrastructure and funding\".\n\nThe budget papers do suggest that the Coalition's policy of introducing \"income management\" for families, including child care, is being designed to protect spending while protecting people's rights to fair treatment, but that doesn't account for any reductions in payments to families, including allowances.\n\nTo see the policy as \"savings\" without paying for it by reducing social services spending is an utterly incomprehensible position. The plan to reduce subsidies on fuel and electricity is one of the most unpopular policies in Australian history, but that has not stopped the government from implementing plans that have the most disastrous implications for health and education.\n\nThis has become a matter of serious public debate in recent weeks. On the one hand, the government has consistently refused to answer basic questions. On the other, the prime minister and other members of the government have talked about savings while talking up the benefits to families from this budget. It is both irresponsible and morally offensive. There is no need to \"spend like you saved\", especially when that \"saving\" does not include addressing other areas of government spending.\n\nThe government promised an election promise", "label": 1, "id": 100133}

She said that before she could find out if it was serious, she had been kidnapped and taken to the police headquarters.\n\n\"I was crying and shouting for help and they told me that if I cried I'd get beaten.

When she called the police station for an update she was told to go there. Within an hour the police arrived and she was again taken away.\n\nThe story, which Farkhunda repeats verbatim, gives a picture of how the police in China operate.\n\nIt is not unheard of for relatives (unusually from among China's ethnic Han majority, which accounts for 70% of the population) of victims of crime to protest against what they perceive to be government excess - or to call for the release of their loved ones. But the way the police behave during the events is entirely unprecedented, says David Coleman, a researcher who studies ethnic relations at Lancaster University.\n\n\"The reaction taken by the police - the use of force and the detentions - is unprecedented,\" he explains. \"The police here just don't seem to know what to do next. They're just going to keep trying to do this until it's over, and they have no idea where to go after this.\"\n\nHe says the authorities have been trying to pin the blame for the unrest on the protesters by suggesting it was a plot, but Farkhunda, who has no children and a husband who is ill, says it was not a conspiracy.\n\nFarkhunda is still not sure why she was detained, or when exactly that happened. But it seems clear that a number of people were imprisoned, and were released late on Sunday night after several hours, or that they had their days in prison extended for more than a day, depending on the source.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption There were numerous protesters during the mass protests\n\nAmong those being seen by relatives as having been arrested was the well-known actor Li Bingbing. China's foreign ministry had earlier identified him as one of the protesters.\n\nIn Beijing, a woman surnamed Fang, from a town near Shaoguan, is among those on a list of people being detained in connection with what has become the largest mass protest in China's modern history.\n\nShe told the BBC she lived in Shaoguan but was now in Xinjiang. She said that in recent days she had gone shopping in the town.\n\n\"The shopping plaza had been completely blocked off - no traffic, no pedestrians, shops shut. Police officers came and told me to remove my clothes, but they wouldn't let me get into my car. They wanted to check it for explosives because there had been a couple of incidents.

She and her baby will soon have about 5-6 cloth diapers a day \u2014 and it is not unusual for a healthy baby to have as many as 12 cloth diapers a day, although the number may be less after she finishes breast-feeding. (See A Baby's Guide to Clean, Dry Cloth Diapers for more details)\n\nTo keep her clean and dry, don't let her sleep in a place with only one or two beds, or anywhere with lots of hard surfaces.\n\nMake sure she stays away from bedding that is more than 4\" thick.

Your baby will definitely be tired after the day's activities (and if you can avoid it, go out in the fresh air after the baby has slept). Make sure he gets his fluids and some love before you start getting him ready for cloth diapers. The next time you are ready, just do some quick roll-outs and keep those cloth diapers in good shape.\n\nTips for Helping Your Baby Cloth Diaper Diaper Trouble\n\nSo, what's the most important thing you can do to help your baby wear his cloth diapers well?\n\nDon't be concerned if your baby has a \"diaper rash,\" or any skin reaction to the pads on his diapers. For most babies, these reactions may be mild and go away with time. If your baby's reactions are more severe, or if he has trouble wearing the diapers or feels very uncomfortable in them, and you notice his skin is becoming red, shiny, itchy, and dry, you may want to bring your baby to the doctor to discuss this.\n\nIf your baby is wearing his disposable diapers with the diapers being wetted out with a wet wipe and a warm wet cloth (called a \"wet napkin\" on some cloth diapers or a \"tote\" on others), he should be dry, shiny, and clean before you wash them!\n\nThis isn't a medical condition called \"allergen cross-reactivity,\" where one baby will easily get sick from a protein from another baby's diaper! This is more like the skin reactivity to a chemical that is on all those other disposable diapers you were so worried about! So bring your baby to the doctor if any of these reactions occur:\n\nReddened, pink, irritated, or tender skin\n\nIrritated, red, itchy, or sore eyes\n\nSwelling and redness of the skin on the buttocks or underarm area\n\nSevere itching\n\nBloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain\n\nNot eating\n\nA general sense of ill- health\n\nIf the reaction is severe or lasts for a long time, and you suspect that your baby is more or less allergic to one or more substances in cloth diapers, he should get checked out by a doctor. This is especially true if you are having trouble with him wearing disposable diapers!\n\nIt's very important to use an allergen-reactive wipes and spray when you are washing baby diapers.

The band was called the Band and they were a big hit with tourists around town. They got all the men out of their seats on the plane, but one woman said, \"Cann't these guys sing? These guys should be famous.\" She was quite right and the band did indeed become famous.\n\nThen another passenger, who wanted to be known as \"Johnny Rotten,\" gave them a lift to our hotel and drove them home that same night.\n\n\nI'm sure nobody will mind my referring to all this as \"Guru's trip.\" (I say that to illustrate the fact that, while I was there, in my case, it was the first such trip that anyone had taken by a group.) I should point out that, in all my years, I have traveled in a group only twice. Only at the age of 9, I was traveling by myself during a period when I was more interested in being a traveling salesman than a traveler. At the age of 17 in the summer of 1944, as an apprentice driver for a trucking company, I had traveled all over Europe and by that time I was somewhat of a traveling salesman because the road between New York and England was a real trip and the only way I could make the trip was by driving my friends, who were all traveling salesmen, around the country. It took me several weeks to learn the map of West Coast roads and a few weeks more to start driving. I would be driving from town to town and talking about a business trip.\n\nIf you've done any traveling and kept abreast of what's going on with the news, you know that in the spring of 1940, the news from Europe was pretty dire and all of Europe was going to Nazi concentration camps, except for Germany. Some things would appear different \u2014 for example, in Britain the Blitz was going to last a much longer time than it did from June until November, 1941, and Germany would be able to put up an offensive that would be almost as devastating as Pearl Harbor.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that at this time, and especially in 1942, a time of great conflict in Europe, the popular traveling salesman in North America was always called \"Guru.\"\n\nIt was, apparently, a tradition of a large number of traveling salespeople that people who could not travel in an emergency, either as a result of their military service or during World War II, would call upon one of their number to come along on trips. After World War II, the travel sales business of North America suffered a big blow \u2014 salespeople no longer had a traveling partner, even though all the companies operating in the United States had salesmen in all 50 American states and in several other countries. I had been doing long-distance selling for a few years before I became involved in the travelling sales of a large mail order retailer \u2014 the first such business in North America, as far as I know. I took over the traveling business of my friend's business and started selling travel over the telephone.\n\nGuru's first trip in the spring of 1943 was, indeed, on behalf of a member of my traveling sales network, who was in the service. By this time I knew a great deal about aircraft (I was the first airplane mechanic in the Western world to have his aircraft repaired), I was a very good listener, I knew many people, and I had already written one book. I also had a good idea of how to make travel entertaining. This was the first trip Guru ever took, and as I had been taking most of his business in the mail, I arranged to have Guru speak in the local radio station of New York- New Jersey area on Sunday, May 20, 1943.

{"text": "To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River, which meanders northeast from the Gulf of Mexico to run east to the Pacific Ocean. This area has experienced relatively warm and dry periods at the beginning of the Holocene, leading the researchers to believe that a high-fat diet could have played a role in enhancing plant growth and productivity.\n\nBut before we start gobbling up carrots, cabbage and turnips, there's a key thing to understand: the study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIt's a great paper! But is it completely relevant, relevant scientifically?\n\nDr. Peter Hogg, a professor at the University of Bath (along with Dr. P.F.W. Tielmann, I think) has been a leader in understanding what dietary impacts would have had on our evolution. When he looks at our primate relatives, Homo sapiens, he's fascinated by the changes they seem to have undergone when they gained a higher caloric intake after the advent of agriculture. The key difference between these animals and us is how many calories they are consuming.\n\nIn the case of chimps, we're getting a hefty 20 to 25 percent of our calorie needs from plant resources; monkeys, our closest living relative, are consuming less than 3%. And it appears that the dietary changes we've made to ourselves have a disproportionate and unintended effect on our health than our fellow apes: it's not enough that we've become larger; we're becoming sick; and we are far more susceptible to coronary heart disease and cancer than our primate forebears.\n\nIt's no surprise that a diet lower in calorie density also seems to lead to obesity. When researchers looked at populations around the world they found that, globally, over the past 20 years or so, about a third of all adults are obese. In the U.S. that number stands at about a fifth, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\nAnd it's possible, it really is conceivable, that if the average person in a modern industrialized Western country were eating less calories, they'd be not only fitter and more energetic, but be perhaps healthier as well.\n\nAs these experts point out, though, it's crucial to remember that there's a lot of data available on the effects of diet on health, from humans, animals and plants alike. There's much about our lives that don't have anything to do with fat or calorie density. Our hormones, digestion, reproduction and evolution are all governed by complex, interacting processes that likely evolved because they make us stronger, more energetic and longer-living. A diet that doesn't necessarily lead to better health simply because it's low in calorie density simply isn't an answer that's relevant enough for research to take place.\n\nAs of yet Dr. Hogg's study has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, so it's difficult to say whether the findings are relevant to our time or not. But, I think that this kind of diet-induced physiological response is just one of the many opportunities that could open up to us when we understand the biology of our own species.\n\nThe potential for a great understanding of this biological reality is really exciting.\n\nWhat has your experience been in going into the lab with the goal of figuring out this mystery?\n\nWell I do work with the lab at the University of Bristol, which has quite an interesting background. It was founded by a guy named David Sinclair in 1947 to look at the effects of different diets on different mammals in different environments. So they study a lot of carnivores in the Arctic, and they work with the great apes to study for example, their metabolism.\n\nI sort of got lucky in that I was able to join an experiment as early as 1984, which was the study on fruit and vegetable consumption in primates. So, we were interested in what was going on physiologically in our primate counterparts, at the base of the food chain, when it comes to their diet. What did they eat? How does it affect metabolism in the body and their metabolic processes? Our study on fruit and vegetable intake in primates was really interesting. We found that even though there was a lot of variation between species in terms of what sort of fruit and vegetables were consumed, the commonalities remained. This led to us hypothesizing that the fruit and vegetable we ate probably had a similar effect on metabolism in this study group versus primates that were fed different diets. The most interesting thing that's occurred since then is that people have since become interested in this in a broader sense, including other food groups and other mammals, for example the baboons, the bonobos and monkeys.\n\nIt's been suggested that there are some health markers in fruit and vegetable consumption as well.\n\nMaybe. I can't be certain though, because it's something that hasn't ever been studied before. I'm sure that that'll become available some day.\n\nThe other thing that", "label": 1, "id": 100138}
{"text": "we present a theoretical analysis of the propagation of light, focusing on its dispersion effect (light dispersal), light emission (radiation), and transmission [1] where as we discuss the effect a small, distant object (e.g., the moon, which is relatively bright) can have on the illumination of a distant light source (such as a light bulb connected to a wall) [2]. The following description of the fundamental physics involved is based on the authors' book Physics of the Moon, including all mathematical aspects [3]. The theory is also based on Newtonian mechanics [4.1].\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a vacuum, the vacuum state has a definite wavelength and zero phase. But in various objects, if there is an external source of light (e.g., a light bulb; see Figure 1) and it emits light (e.g., through a tube or window), the light will scatter (or, more appropriately, be scattered by particles scattered from the source and absorbed by the surface of the object itself; e.g., light bulbs are made of many thousands of thin layers of material that absorb and reemit light), either in the same direction as the light, or in all directions, depending on the incident angle of the light.\n\nThis scattering will cause the light to lose frequency, which is a quantity expressed in the form of a spectrum, which represents the combination of all frequencies in a given electromagnetic wave. An arbitrary object or surface emits and absorbs light (e.g., the moon). However, if that light is scattered by other objects (e,g., the objects are large and the moon is small, as in Figure 1), a signal, or interference pattern becomes visible and the objects will form an interference pattern (i.e., an energy pattern), which is a continuous, unbroken wave. The wave cannot have the same two different frequencies if there is not strong scattering, because such a pattern would be difficult to detect by a human eye. In addition, if the light from the source is attenuated in the distance (as is typical of the case of a light bulb) and then reemitted, this pattern would be \"flattened\" out.\n\nAn example of an interference pattern is that which is seen in the Moon, where the moon appears to have a slightly darker, circular shadow on the surface, while the background Earth surface is illuminated by the sun (the surface of the moon is the background to the Sun). In this example, the pattern is due to the scattering of the reflected illumination by the dust on the surface of the moon. A similar effect can be seen on the Earth. The Earth's surface appears to have a similar pattern to that of the Moon as a result of interference between the sky and the sun.\n\nThe spectrum of light emitted by the earth is characterized by a spectrum that is composed of a broad band of the frequency range around 860 nanometer. The sky in the sky is brighter than the Earth, and the spectrum does not extend over the entire sky, but is restricted to a few selected areas. There are two bands, one being around 650 nanometer and the other around 680 nanometer. This spectrum is also reflected from the surface of the Earth and the Moon (this reflected signal is known as the refracted light). The first band, 650 nanometer is light in the red and orange portion of the spectrum, whereas the second band, 680 nanometer is light in the yellow, green, and blue frequencies. The wavelengths range from around 450 nanometer to 700 nanometer. Therefore, light in the 650 nanometer, 680 nanometer range reaches the Earth in around 600 nanometer by refraction and around 1000 nanometer by atmospheric scattering and is not transmitted efficiently by the atmosphere.\n\nIf the sky is dark, the spectrum can be seen on the surface of the moon, but as light in the violet and green (near-infrared) portion of the spectrum falls on the upper part of the lunar surface and is not reflected, the spectrum is reduced and does not reach the atmosphere, even though the light of the sun still reaches the Earth. In addition, if the sky is high (as can result from heavy clouds, such as cirrus) and the spectrum is concentrated into a region and the atmosphere does not scatter and the atmosphere is less efficient at scattering, the spectrum is reduced with only the violet portion reaching the atmosphere. If the sky is very diffuse and the sky is low, the light from the sun can reach the Earth at high wavelengths.\n\nLight is known to be non-uniform in its wavelength, thus an object, e.g., the moon, emits or absorbs light of different bands depending on how the object is viewed or viewed from another view point, e.g., the surface of the moon reflected by the Earth or the surface of the moon reflecting sunlight. Thus, the moon, which is very bright, will see light that is the yellow band more than the blue, which", "label": 1, "id": 100139}

{"text": "a new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is observed in which an interference pattern of three different directions is observed at a distance of 3 mm from the source. This object is a single photon [13], and can be defined by assuming it to be a single quantum system and measuring its position. We find that its position is in fact determined by two quantum states and that quantum position in light-matter interaction depends on the nature of these interacting objects.\n\nA key issue in quantum mechanics is that the quantum-mechanical state of the system can be affected and even the behavior of the underlying system can depend on the state of the quantum system. For example, the two photons in Fig. 2 can be in different states, and they can be entangled [14] to influence the individual positions of the other two photons within the same experiment. The photons are entangled with an external photon-positron pair, such as the radioactive positron and ion, via a CPT of the experimenter in Fig. 1. The fact that their individual position relies on the other photons and not of the experimenter, and that the state of each individual photon depends on the combination of the photons it encounters, have been experimentally observed by a variety of experimentalists [15\u201317].\n\nA fundamental assumption in quantum mechanics is that no matter can appear and disappear in a quantum state instantaneously [18] (Fig. 5). Therefore, in order to measure the individual positions of two particles simultaneously, the two photons cannot be sent ahead of each other to the experiment. In this case, the source-observer system has to wait until the photons are sent asynchronously. For a quantum system, such instantaneous measurement would mean that each particle is simultaneously measured in its own state. This would be an incoherent state [19] and a contradiction to the theory described in the previous section.\n\nIn fact, the laws of quantum mechanics imply that the two photons are in the same state at the start of the experiment because they are simultaneously measured while the measurement device records their individual positions [19\u201322]. However, a number of measurement devices, such as interferometers, detectors, measurement beams and quantum detectors, can measure particles of different states simultaneously. As the photons that appear in both the detectors are measured simultaneously, their individual positions at the start of the experiment are independent. However, in a measurement device in which the particles could be placed in space, the position of the photons that appear in the one detector would always be at least partially dependent on the position of the particles that will appear in the other detector because, as we will see later, they are bound by the CPT that defines the state of the two photons. If we consider the particle-antiparticle interaction as a special case, if we consider the particles to be entangled with each other, only a measurement of the state of an interacting particle will determine its state at a later time. Therefore, in this situation, the state of the entangled particle depends on the values of the two particles at the start, which in some cases is very small [23, 24].\n\nIt is possible to overcome this limitation by replacing each observer with a second observer and making the entangled state of one superposition state, as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the CPT can be extended to superposition states by adding \"coupling\" between pairs of observers [23].\n\nThe CPT of a set of quantum states may be described by two states that are identical to each other, one for each observer at the start of the experiment. The two states are called \"state 1\" of a set of quantum states and \"state 2\" of a superposition of quantum states of the two observers respectively. An example is given in Fig. 4. The two states of a set of quantum states (which will be called 1, 2 in Fig. 6) are superposition states because no observer can ever be in both states at the same time. The state 1 and 2 states can be found by calculating the probabilities of the states 1 and 2 for each possible measurement event, and then performing a probabilistic measurement to see if the measurement event resulted in a measurement at 1 or 2, respectively (Fig. 6). The probability that a measurement event at 1 would result in a measurement at 2 is 1 - 1/2; the probability that a measurement event at 2 would result in the measurement at 1 is 1 - 1/2. If the probability that a measurement at 1 would result in both measurements at 2 (i.e. state 1 of a set of quantum states), the state 1 and 2 corresponding to the probability of the set is the same (1/2). The probabilities of the superposition is therefore the same for any observer. Therefore, the states 1, 2 can be considered as superposition states of the quantum state 1, respectively. These superposition states are referred to as 1, 2 superposition states of the set 1. Since the", "label": 1, "id": 100144}

Ben decides to research fanfic's and find out who started the events that brought down the Wehrmacht and led to the end of the war. This leads to them finding the real war. What follows is a story of friendship, honor, and the horrors of war, combined with a young adult story with magic. It is an epic adventure that will have you saying \"I want more!\"This novel has everything! We have characters, action, action scenes, romance (in a nonsexual way). We have humor, but it's a more adult-rated version of humour. There are two endings. At the end of this book you can decide a few things and have some fun, or you can let it end and get the ending you really want.This review has no images!If you've come to this review in search of a spoiler-free preview of War of the Fanboys then you might just be in luck.

I never read YA fantasy novels and I had heard such a dreadful lot about them. I figured all the reviews were either from people who'd never read a book like this or people who'd heard of the book and didn't want to leave. On the day of release Ben contacted me and said the book was not a typical YA fantasy. \"It's more like Young Adult,\" he said. I was a bit skeptical and decided to read it alone. Once I started to read it I fell in love with it. I went back and read some of Ben's other fiction after reading this one and found more than an equal amount of entertainment. It was definitely a different experience reading War of the Fanboys than reading any of his other fiction. It's fun, engaging, and, if you're a YA reader, you won't be disappointed with it.

Her friends tell her that they believe in her. They support her; their support lets her know that most people do. She's heard a ton of weird stories and jokes at bars, in locker rooms, and even at weddings. They tell her things that were once unthinkable in their community. Now, her friends see her as the same person they saw her before she changed her name, changed her body, and began to feel trapped.\n\nSome people have different opinions about the name change \u2014 some people find the name change offensive; some people find it liberating. For us, we see it not as liberating at all, but as threatening. Why is it so hard to let people make these transitions? If everyone who felt comfortable with their transition was able to do so, this would reduce the discrimination many transgender people face in everyday settings. Why can't we just change our name? Why couldn't Karen call herself Megan and nobody care?\n\nKaren Carpenter grew up in a small town in Texas called Mansfield, a suburb of Houston known as a hub for oil exploration. She was born into a close-knit family, the son of a well-respected Methodist preacher. Her father taught Karen to sing at church. The family lived in the small town that was known for its small-town ideals.\n\nHer father said Karen's father used to look at his son with disdain and tell him, \"you don't have a body, you have what I have.\" When Karen was young, her father was a very religious and strict man. He once stood up to Karen on a trip to the store. He was furious a local barber had cut the daughter's hair short. He said, \"This little twerp cut a girl short!\" Karen remembers the man telling her that his daughter couldn't ever cut her hair short again. Eventually, Karen grew more comfortable with her body, but she rarely spoke about it with others as this happened.\n\n\"There is a sense of shame, where if you want someone's attention for your own reasons, it is easier to be quiet and not talk about it,\" Carpenter said.\n\nShe said this is a very common thing she feels. She says it has kept her in the closet to this day; she doesn't know any transgender girl whose father doesn't say the same thing.\n\nKaren moved to Dallas to attend UT before she was ready to transition. She found a job as a makeup artist, but her boss was in a relationship with another woman and didn't know that Karen was a lesbian. It wasn't so much the work that bothered Karen, but the fact her boss thought differently about her than she ever had before.\n\nWhat Karen didn't realize at the time was that being a lesbian was the reason this situation was so awkward. She had always thought of herself as being attracted to men. She had been exposed to a gay community, watched them raise kids, and heard the stories of them. In fact, even as a child, Karen used to watch these kids at bars, and even in her teens used to go to bars to watch them get their nails done. It was an almost impossible scenario for her to ignore \u2014 having a man be attracted to her. To have to deny those deeply personal emotions was too much. In a desperate moment, she told her girlfriend she was a lesbian and never tried to hide it again. That was the beginning of Karen's first lesbian relationship.\n\n\"It was at that time, this realization, that I looked at my male privilege and said, 'how can I begin to fight for these things without taking things away from others as well?'\" Karen recalled. \"There are too many people who don't have things that I have.\"\n\nThis is why we have to take our privilege away, she said, because if we don't, they will never ever get it. That was what motivated the first song on her debut album, \"Barely Legal,\" which is about living her life on the outside looking in until she is ready to share her secret without fear of judgment.\n\nMany people who identify as transgender have found their way to Karen Carpenter's album \"Barely Legal\" over the years \u2014 when Karen sings \"brave\" she sings for a lot of others \u2014 because they know she has had to fight a lot in order to live her actual life.

These findings are corroborated by the high percentage of patients with either unilateral or bilateral cortical deformities. These findings suggest a complex relationship between cortical lesions and the perception of depth of field and may be a major contributor to the clinical picture of MS.\n\nThe importance of axial images in MS diagnosis can be understood in the context of the unique clinical presentation of this disease. The lesions found in the MS axial neuropathysm are not the cause for the clinical image. Instead, MS lesions can be caused by the pathological process of MS or by the physiological deterioration of one of its various stages that can be triggered by a range of pathological and environmental factors. It may be that an individual patient with an MS lesion is actually a hyperopic (or hyperopic-hypopic) patient. The axial brain images could be consistent with the clinical picture by making the distinction between an MS lesion (e.g., macular degeneration, meningioma, gliosis of the meninges) and a patient with another CNS tumor or disease (e.g., ALS). By using this criteria as a screening tool for MS, the findings from our study would potentially be more useful for MS diagnosing, and consequently, will be more likely to be found in MS patients.\n\nFigure 2.

The new version of the -doublet and -duplex model have been introduced to enable an easier interpretation of the CSPF (as described in the alignments paper).\n\nAnd, of course, there is a small extension of the -doublet model, which is of special interest for NHE and HHE.\n\nTo use the model:\n\ncd nxopt/data/dynamic/dynamic/dynamic_lut.txt echo -n 'N:d (1:N)=d (0:1)=d' >>./output/dynamic_lut\n\nwhere N is the alignment depth\n\nTo use the model using a -first-order-prediction in NHE:\n\necho -n 'N:d (1:N)>=d (0:1)' >>./output/nh_dynamic_prediction_lut\n\nand for higher-order prediction (DVP, DFT, KDT)\n\necho -n 'N:d (1:N)>=d (0:1)>=d' >>./output/hdp_dynamic_prediction_lut and\n\nfor higher-order models (DPP or DPM):\n\necho -n 'N:d (1:N)>=d (0:1)' >>./output/npcm_dynamic_prediction_lut\n\nNote that the -first-order-prediction model only works if all the models have been implemented.\n\nThe -first-order-prediction model for doublet models is more complex (this is a doublet problem!). It involves computing the expected intensity, which is calculated as follows:\n\nmax0 = mean(v0) / (abs(x-max0) + 2 * mean(v1) / (abs(x-max1) + 2 * mean(v2)))\n\nTo see a real example, see the CSPF paper. Notice, that the model uses DVP, DFT, KDT and DPV. For comparison, the -dipd and -dipm models work also for doublet problems, but the doublet model is much more complex.\n\nAll-Pairs Pairs (AP) models are the main algorithms in machine learning. They are more complex models in the sense that the alignment process is not used for all the pairs analyzed. The idea is to analyze multiple pairs and align the sequences correctly to all of them. The original motivation for AP models is to identify rare sequences. This can be done by using single-end sequencing or high-throughput sequencing techniques for detecting rare sequences in sequence databases. The original AP models can also be implemented for other alignments problem. A key feature of all-Pairs (AP) models is the fact that the alignment result is a collection of paired sequences, all of which have to be aligned correctly to each other. When comparing the alignment between two sequences, it can be helpful to examine the alignment between them for common pairs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of AP models is that they align sequences without knowing the alignment structure (i.e. with just alignment information for one pairing). That is, all that needs to be done is to create a list of paired sequences (or other combinations of sequences); then, the AP models simply align all the pairs to that list. Of course, any number of different pairs can be used. The model can also be applied to N-pairs alignment (in which each pair needs to be analyzed independently).\n\nHere is an example for N-Pairs Pairs (NAPP) model and in which we align all pairs using single-end sequencing methods:\n\necho -n 'N:N P:T' >>./output/align_dipm_nAPp\n\nWhere N is the alignment depth\n\nP is (e.g.) the alignment length\n\nT is (e.g.) the number of shared boundaries (e.g., T1 and T2)\n\nWhen creating a -single-end -all-Pairs -all-pairs AP model, we first use a single-end alignment method, in which both sequence alignments are created at one sequence or several sequences. This corresponds to the standard AP alignment model; here are the steps:\n\ncreate pairs by aligning sequences using different single-end sequencing methods, without knowing the alignment structure; generate alignments, with shared boundaries between sequence pairs; create pair lists\n\nThis can be implemented in C by the function createpairlist(), that uses all of the standard function callbacks:\n\n#include <stdlib.h> #include <", "label": 1, "id": 100149}

He also had marked chest pain, respiratory distress, and heart failure. He had a history of alcohol ingestion and marijuana abuse. On the basis of his history, his physical examination, and the findings of the laboratory tests, he was sent for an EKG (normal), a CT scan (normal), a chest x-ray (normal), and a computed tomography (CT) scan (normal).\n\nTreatment for this patient was directed to rest, rest, and relaxation. He was instructed to stay off of all pharmaceuticals, to limit physical activity and vigorous exercise (further, he was told to wear a chest harness in order to avoid a pneumothorax). He was also told to wear a head collar to minimize the risk of aspiration of stomach contents and of swallowing fluids. He was given intravenous fluids. He was given a prescription for loperamide 50mg with instructions to take this medication at least twice a day to relieve his symptoms.\n\nA 48-year - old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room with a 4-hour history of nausea, vomiting, lethargy, weakness, and fatigue. She was also experiencing acute abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distention (pericardial effusion), and fatigue. On lab testing, she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis due to a perforating ulcer and she was advised to continue with antibiotic treatment to control the inflammation. She was given intravenous fluids. A history of alcohol abuse, cocaine abuse, and marijuana abuse were also noted.\n\nHer physical examination revealed a head injury. On the basis of her physical examination, CT scan, and lab studies, she was instructed to rest, stay off of all pharmaceuticals and exercise and stop her sedentary behavior so that she could heal and remain free of the infection. A chest x-ray revealed a perforating ulcer in the inferior wall of her left chest, which had undergone subdural hematoma formation (a small air pocket between the soft tissue of the brain and the dural sheath of the skull). A CT scan revealed that the left hemoperitoneum had also been obliterated. She was then given acetaminophen for pain and nausea and was discharged home.\n\nA 52-year - old Hispanic woman presented to the emergency room with a 3-hour history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She was given intravenous fluids for nausea and vomiting. She was also given an epinephrine autoinjector and was instructed to breathe normally on the medication. She had been experiencing fever and weight loss, and was instructed to follow the treatment instructions for her diabetes. She was also given an acetaminophen product for her pain and fever. A CT scan revealed a left hemoperitoneum obliterated and no heart or lung structures. Upon further evaluation, the patient had an acute pancreatitis with perforation of the left side of the pancreas and damage to the left pulmonary vein. Upon prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy, she was given oral meds and discharged home.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study was designed to characterize changes in the pancreas following perforation, specifically to evaluate whether the presence of a perforation was a contributing factor to the onset of disease or if other causes were involved in development and progression of disease.\n\nThe primary finding of this study was the significant change in the pancreas following the subdural hematoma perforation. In the present study, perforation alone was not associated with the onset of any significant clinical signs.\n\nIn a previous study, Corder et al [6] found increased pancreatic levels of FGF21 and increased insulin levels following perforation of the pancreas. These elevated levels do not appear in the present study to be indicative of pancreatitis.\n\nThe most significant finding in this study is that both the left and right hemoperitoneums were obliterated due to the perforation. The left and right hemoperitoneum are important in terms of the flow of nutrients and nutrients to the organs. Therefore, the loss of the left and right hemoperitoneum must be considered in addition to the significant deterioration of the pancreas postperforation.\n\nThe fact that the left and right hemoperitoneums showed only significant change following perforation further supports the concept that the left hemoperitoneum has some type of essential role in supplying nutrients to the pancreas after perforation and the right hemoperitoneum has some type of essential role in supplying nutrients to the pancreas after perforation. Therefore, the left and right hemoperitoneum are important not only as means of supplying nutrients to the pancreas during perforation but also to regulate flow of nutrients to and from the organs after perforation.", "label": 1, "id": 100150}
{"text": "tuberculosis ( tb ) has been a disease affecting almost every human population in Europe since prehistoric times, particularly in the north and east, which has contributed a considerable portion to the rise of human populations in those areas. Its cause remains unknown. The last two infectious diseases (tuberculosis, pertussis, and small pox) were eliminated from European health systems in modern times with the advent of vaccinations. Most of the diseases that affected humans in the past have either been eliminated from our populations or have become relatively rare. In the past ten years, however, a significant number of diseases have reappeared.\n\nAs early as the Middle Ages, the use of opium, laudanum, mephitoxin, strychnine, and other drugs in medicine was widely publicized. The use of narcotics became widespread in Europe in the 16th century, and the use of narcotics in the U.S. since the 1890s probably predates that.1\u20133 From the 15th to the early 17th century the use of opium was a daily occurrence throughout Europe.4 It was also common in the Mediterranean region.5 The use of opium increased during medieval times and was associated with a significant rise in mortality rates.6 In the 17th century, the use of opium for pain and opium for \"indolence\"\u2014analgesics for headache and backache\u2014became widely recognized. The use of opium became widespread in Europe and spread to other continents by the early 1800s.7\n\nAlthough opium use was widely known and widely observed, its use continued until the 19th century. The first large-scale use for therapeutic reasons was noted in 1664,7 a time when opioids were used for a variety of disease symptoms. The first written record of the use of opium for therapeutic purposes in patients in London was in 1666. In 1676, John Wollaston, the physician to Queen Elizabeth, described the use of opium on children and said \"so great abuse of the drug in the treatment of the sick can hardly be imagined,\" while elsewhere his observations describe the use of opium to relieve the pain of spaying or castrating horses.8 In 1740 a London physician described a 16-year-old male patient in the hospital in which he worked who had been given morphine for post-operative pain.9 By 1840, there were some 400 papers in various medical journals that described the use of morphine for the treatment of various diseases.\n\nA remarkable change occurred about 1850 when the European nations began to use opium primarily for the treatment of chronic or terminal illnesses to relieve pain, as an anesthetic, for the relief of insomnia, and for the treatment of various opium withdrawal symptoms.10 In 1856 a Russian doctor, H.G. Myshkin, was one of the first to be trained in the medicinal use of opium and to publish a review on its use for pain, which received wide circulation in the medical literature. By 1860, there were about 30 thousand people receiving medical aid through opium.11\n\nIn 1870 French chemists were the first to develop the selective opium-precipitating solution ( POP) to treat many diseases. This was the first method of opium administration which worked effectively in the modern sense that it had the capability of controlling one's appetite to facilitate its delivery, without overdose. There were three basic steps: (1) the patient inhaled POP, (2) the POP precipitated in the lungs was excreted in urine or aqueous humor, and (3) the patient swallowed the urine or aqueous juice in order to release the POP in the mouth. Some patients became dependent on the POP-induced release of heroin from the tissue of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDuring the 19th century, morphine obtained by chemical isolation was widely used as the agent of choice for its ability to produce analgesia. It was also considered the standard of care for its effectiveness in treating respiratory conditions and the pain and weakness of cancer patients. It was used, however, only occasionally for the treatment of the pain in cancer of the upper respiratory tract.\n\nIn 1879 Alexander Fleming discovered the structure of the analgesic analgesic. He named it morphine which in turn became the common name for all known analgesic molecules.\n\nToday, opium for drug use is administered by a variety of routes, from aerosol, topical solution, transdermal patches, or ointment to injection or injection into the muscle. Opiates are sometimes sold as prescription medication and may be dispensed over the counter (OTC) to the general public under a variety of names. Opiate overdose deaths have occurred rarely with the exception of an accidental overdose of codeine by four employees of the California Department of Health Services in 1985 that killed one additional employee and three hospital employees.12\n\nIn the United States in the mid-1990s, a new series of highly-addictive opioids has emerged.

{"text": "The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of the show, so I'll simply say it offers up a number of classic elements from film and television.\n\nA man, played by a man, and a woman, played by a woman, go undercover.\n\nYou don't have to know anything about the first element you watch in order to appreciate the second one, and neither do I, but what this show does well is give the viewer a feeling of immersion into what we're going to witness and how we'll experience it.\n\nFirst they meet, a new woman named Elsie Smith (the only woman in the film) and she's going undercover to find out about another organization using children as spies. While we see the action from her point of view, we're privy not only to her opinion of the man we're seeing, but also a bit about her history.\n\nThat man she's going to meet is Joe Keiser, one of the lead employees of Keiser Intelligence, so it's not like she's gonna have any sympathy for him. She's going on a mission to try to get information about the family that runs the organization, and Keiser is one of three men that she finds out about. She falls in love with him immediately.\n\nThis is a love scene between two people and it's one of the better parts of this film. You really get a feeling of how they're meant for each other from the second she arrives in the house until they kiss just a few lines later.\n\nThe other two men are played by the same man and the two men do have very different opinions of the other, which is a problem given that the two men have two very different paths in life with their two distinct personalities. What I appreciated most about these men was the fact that they're the only two characters to have an actual scene with them between both acts of the movie.\n\nAnother great part of the plot is the fact that you don't really get to see all of the kids on the set. It's very likely that you will find certain characters in the film with whom you'll know more about. The kids are given multiple moments of characterization and you're allowed to understand why a certain character has the reactions they have. There's a part where Keiser's young son goes out to play and comes home with a friend and they don't speak and that's only a few minutes in the film. This is one of the few films that does well portraying the growing pains of growing up.\n\nThe kids act like teenagers and it shows. When you see the two kids that don't quite fit in with those that do, it's difficult to imagine them as adults, but that's exactly what they are. They get caught in the middle of a political war between two sides, and you can guess what'll happen next.\n\nThis film was made for adults, but for the most part, it's a film that feels like a film meant for any age. The only thing older I'd ever even consider is The Matrix, and I don't give a shit if you want to point at that as a bad example. It's a great series for any age.\n\nOverall, this is a great film. I recommend it.\n\nThe film stars: Paul Giamatti\n\nRating: 7 as an adult, 10 as a teen\n\nI Am Legend (1990)\n\nIt doesn't matter if you think horror belongs in the \"genre\" category. Some films just do it better than others, and a lot of horror doesn't belong in the \"genre\" category.\n\nThere's no denying that IAmLegion is a classic horror film, because it's definitely a horror film. It's about a woman who is kidnapped by a group of people and she ends up being in their town. The way she's treated makes her feel as though she's being treated as a slave and a bitch for not doing what they want, which I can relate to to some degree as well. But we watch this film as a group and we see her being abused with every opportunity, and the group eventually decides to kill her instead.\n\nYou know, if you want to play the blame game, if you want to go onto YouTube to have a lecture about movies or whatever, blame IAmLegion! But then again, I also don't give a fucking shit who caused the genocide.\n\nNow, I can't help but feel that this remake is a very modern classic. It's almost like an updated version of some of the movies that you've probably seen on the Twilight Zone. That's not to say those movies aren't good films. They are. They just don't share a lot in common with the modern version of this film.\n\nThe film opens in a hospital, where a woman is being treated for a gunshot wound she got in a fight with her husband.

{"text": "With the windows down, I sang along to cheesy Mediterranean pop tunes on my iPod while looking through old pictures of my parents' trip. One picture showed a man, clearly not my dad, running after my mom through a field dressed like a soldier in camouflage. I knew this was my dad who, like my grandma, liked to take his clothes off in public because it was his way of being different, of being an outsider. It was not the same as my dad's choice, which was to be more humble and more of a \"normal\" middle-class guy. I felt as if I wanted to run, too, to be part of this family and participate in this weird show.\n\nIn the next photo, I saw my dad with my mom's friend. I knew the picture wasn't me, but I still wanted to see who he was with \u2014 an \"other.\" I ran over to him and began to tell him I was sorry. My father didn't want to hear it. He stood up and walked toward the bushes, turned toward me and told me if he saw how happy I looked that night I would go to prison for a long time and he would have to protect me. In my father's eyes, an invisible child had turned on a mirror, just as my mother always told me to do when I was angry. She'd warned me that the adult world would treat me accordingly. She'd told me that I needed to learn to act nice and behave like a \"grown-up.\" But I was not a grown-up, he said as he walked away. I was supposed to be this girl who didn't know she was a girl, who wore pink lipstick and played in her mother's makeup bag. I was supposed to want to dress up like a \"man\" in adult situations, so that I wouldn't be attacked by the grown-ups, the strangers everywhere.\n\nAfter making that statement of rejection, my father and I walked out into the parking lot and watched that van on the side of the road. The sky was blue, and it was so quiet. We sat in our car together and watched the news, then we stopped at a gas station to get fuel for whatever it was that I was about to do that night.\n\n* * *\n\nA few days later, I took my dad to a baseball game. I told him how nervous I was. He laughed because he knew how much I liked baseball and that I loved being out there with all those people, especially my dad. We saw the Mets play the Dodgers on Sunday, and then we went to a pizza place nearby. I told him that I needed to be alone, alone with my thoughts \u2014 that something needed to happen right then, but I was determined to think about something else. I put my glasses back on my face and looked at my dad, then looked at the sky. My father told me that I never needed to be alone and that even when I was alone, with my thoughts, I was still happy. He said that I was a great daughter, that I did everything right. He told me that he was proud of me because I didn't take this decision lightly. All of these things made me happy. That, he said, was the only way I was ever meant to be.\n\nHis words made me feel relieved. I didn't need to tell him about my boyfriend at work. I could give my father some peace. But as I was leaving the store with him, I thought back to some words he had written in my notebook. Before he left for the game with my friends, he had written something different. He wrote the words of a parent of an eight-year-old girl who is transgender.\n\nIn my notebook, I had written: \"I was born with a male body and I have always wanted to be that girl. Now I am. I am so happy.\"\n\nI remember looking around at everyone as they went to the ballpark and I looked at myself, my face completely covered with makeup. I felt embarrassed. I wanted to keep looking in the mirror, but instead I walked away from the store with the rest of my family. I had to look her in the eyes, but I wanted to look away. I wanted to avoid the stares.\n\n* * *\n\nMy dad was not alone \u2014 people were with him. People who had the same dream to be that girl. People who also made the same promise to protect me. People who didn't just watch the game with him and his friends, but also the rest of his family and even his neighbors. People who showed me the signs that were in my journal that read: \"You can be happy.\" Others were like old family members. They shared the same dreams as my dad, and people were with them. When I looked back, I recognized many of these people \u2014 my cousins, aunts and uncles, my mother's friends. Each and every one", "label": 1, "id": 100153}

{"text": "PhotosYou've seen them on TV. They're the better\u2014and often the more\u2014quality images. What you might not have seen is the work that goes into capturing one of these gorgeous photos. I'll explain how the Canon 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor works, along with a few tips and tricks. You'll receive over 10 hours of continuous on-camera time to see how well the Canon 1DX Mark II captures these stunning images.\n\nWant more video from the Canon 1DX Mark II? Here's a quick run-down that will show you how it all works. If you're a hobbyist, there's more.\n\nImage Files I had a question about some images. I know the image is a little blurry, but why is it blurry? The answer to my questions is pretty simple. The image file was captured using the Raw image format by the Canon 1DX Mark II. Raw files, which can be shot to any of Canon's cameras, give you full dynamic range where possible and retain the resolution of the original film or digital media. (Some cameras have a special RAW mode which can be used with other raw formats to achieve even more incredible results.)\n\nThe following video show you one of the first images you'll get from the Canon 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor.\n\nRaw files are the best way to shoot the Canon 1DX Mark II, since the sensor is better than anything else on the market. This is in large part because of the ability of the 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel CMOS sensor to capture images at all ISO settings, even up to 6500.\n\nCanon 1DX Mark II vs. the Canon 1DX\n\nAlthough you might be under the impression that an APS-C sensor is better at low-light photography, the Canon 1DX Mark II gets there without a doubt. This is in part because of the sensor's excellent dynamic range and low contrast. In addition, a sensor like the 1DX Mark II's can capture colors you've never seen before (e.g., the purple in \"Rainbows Before and After,\" below).\n\nCanon 1DX Mark II vs. the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS STM Lens\n\nThe 1DX Mark II's image quality is impressive, but it was a little surprising to see how much better the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS STM Lens performs compared to the Canon 1DX Mark II. With the 14-bit RAW format available on the Canon 1DX Mark II, it makes using an all-around standard lens like this one a more economical choice, although still not ideal when you're shooting in HDR mode and need a wide angle zoom to do the job.\n\nThe camera's great, but it needs to be optimized for its features \u2014 more on that in a little bit!\n\n1DX Mark II's Optical Built-in Lenses\n\nI'm a fan of Canon's wide-angle zooms, but I knew this would be a good focal length if my primary purpose was to use it on the 1DX Mark II. After reading about how great the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS II USM Lens was for the Canon 1DX Mark II, I didn't hesitate to order a copy of that lens.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. For its price and size, the 70-200mm lens really delivers!\n\nCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS II USM Lens\n\nCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 IS USM Lens\n\nHere, you can see the Canon 70-200mm IS has a nice size of just under an inch long and a weight near a pound, making it one of the more lightweight lenses I have in my own collection. For more information on the Canon 1DX Mark II's 17-55mm IS, you can read my full Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 IS USM Lens analysis to learn more.\n\nNikon 1DX Mark II vs. Canon 1DX versus Nikon D7000, Nikon D40, Nikon D70\n\nWhen I first started shooting with my Nikon 1DX Mark II (review), I was surprised by how well these lenses performed. I'd never shot a zoom lens with no lens hood and always had my lens hood with me, since I wanted to protect my eyes from the lens. Not anymore!\n\nNot much difference between the 1DX Mark II and the 1DX, but when shooting with 1DX images, you will see a very slight increase in dynamic range in the shadows. Not nearly enough to be noticeable, but I did notice the sharpness of the 1DX images noticeably improved.\n\nI found the Canon lens a little more stable in bad weather and", "label": 1, "id": 100160}

{"text": "the involvement of reactive oxygen species in various diseases has been shown. This review summarizes the knowledge regarding ROS in brain injury using various experimental approaches. ROS are potentially harmful as they are emitted from cells damaged by injury and damage causes cellular degeneration. ROS are usually produced in the brain during various pathological phenomena including arechemic brain cell damage and ischemia, microvascular or oxidative damages, hypoxic brain injury and oxidative stress, inflammatory brain injury, cerebral ischemia and micro- or nanostructural brain injury. Thus, ROS are responsible for a variety of biological events in tissues and cells. ROS are activated in various pathological conditions through a number of pathways including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by antioxidants, apoptotic mechanisms, and direct damage from free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS in brain have been described and are primarily responsible for metabolic, metabolic and pathophysiological cell death. ROS can act through the generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species by oxidants, including ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and H 2 O 2 and are also involved in the activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in various pathways involved in the pathophysiological states including neuronal plastic, neuronal death, protein phosphatase activation, apoptosis, cytokine generation and cell cycle arrest. There are a variety of ROS in the brain and a great variety of cellular mechanisms involved. Furthermore, the role of ROS in brain injury is very complex, considering the many ways in which ROS can lead cell death.\n\nBrain injury is a clinical and research field of great importance with different approaches and strategies used to deal with brain injury. In addition to the extensive literature on the role of ROS and the cellular damage following brain injury and the potential role of antioxidants in brain injury, a variety of experimental approaches have been developed in order to detect and quantify ROS and to identify ROS-specific proteins. An abundance of experimental models have been developed to investigate various neurodegenerative processes after brain injury including ischemia, cellular death, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. It will be described here that various mechanisms of oxidative damage and ROS generation after brain injury have been examined in the laboratory and in vivo in various models. Such experimental approaches, if validated, can provide a very good basis for the treatment and understanding of brain injury, particularly in neurological patients.", "label": 1, "id": 100163}

{"text": "The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical object. However, if we think of the class P to be an array of integers, then the class is in fact a higher order operator, similar to a function. In fact, the operators are also called infix operators because the operator is applied directly after the arguments. Also, some operators have the class precedence. For example, == is not in the list of infix operators.\n\nTo be able to recognize the arguments to a function you need to call it with the arguments you have. Moreover, to understand how the argument is passed as a list, you need to understand the structure which allows you to see all the arguments at once. In other words, there are several different structures which allows you to make the arguments as a list.\n\nThis post will discuss the structure of the functions from the following list:\n\n+. +, and -.\n\n., and. -. and %.\n\nand. *, %1, %2,....\n\n, %1, %2,.... /,. /, and /^.\n\nThe next post will discuss the structure of the arguments to the functions from the list:\n\n&, |, <<, >>, ^. and ^^.\n\nand Finally, we will discuss the structure of the data types used by the functions and their relation with the functions.\n\nData types\n\nLet's first go through the structure of the structures we mentioned in the previous post.\n\nHere are the structures of the data types we mentioned:\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type }\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type }\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type; s : Type; s : [T]; s : [[T]] }\n\n{x: Type;y:Type}\n\n\nIn a regular function, each of these structures is the actual argument of the function. In contrast, for functions which are overloaded, we provide a structure for each argument. The structure specifies what type of arguments the function can take. In other words, \"I want to do this, so I have a structure called s\".\n\nThese data types are sometimes called data-structures. Here are some examples:\n\nMap is a list of strings.\n\nis a list of strings. Set is a set that includes elements of different types.\n\nis a set that includes elements of different types. Dictionary is a list of key/value pairs.\n\nis a list of key/value pairs. List is a sequence of functions.\n\nis a sequence of functions. Array is a list of arrays.\n\nis a list of arrays. Seq is a sequence of numbers.\n\nA data-structures contains these elements.

{"text": "Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but with an unproven hypothesis being tested, further testing is recommended. This test compares and contrasts the results from the current model compared with the model of the unknown. The similarity of two models should be the same if the class with both classes are identical in the class matrix. Thus two models should look roughly the same if they have the same number of unknowns from both the current model and one of the proposed unknown classes. It will be hard to get a more precise idea by comparing the relative sizes of two unknown classes, but it will be good enough, as any difference less than about 40%, will be acceptable.\n\nIt is usually difficult to figure out which class is right, and hence, a good strategy for using our proposed test is to use the proposed class as-is and to check that there are no differences that would require a new test. As an example, suppose for instance, that the Class 1 with a large number of unknowns is the same as the Class 2 model, but the Class 3 with small unknowns is different from the two classes, and the two classes are still of the same kind, i.e., two similar-sized classes. Assuming that most of the class variance will come from the Class 1 in our test, this is a good indication that this class is the correct one.\n\nIf tests are to be performed on large numbers of classes, this method is likely to be not sufficient, especially if some classes are well-understood when compared to the proposed class. In the end, a test where we identify classes without testing them will be very wasteful. The proposed class test does not guarantee that the test will be applied. Rather, it is intended to help determine whether our proposed class is the class of interest. If the proposed class is not significant, yet does not rule out others, then the test should still be run.\n\nAnother reason to not use the class test is that it does not take the number of classes into consideration. For example, consider a class of 20 classes, each with a size of 10 or 15. Let us be conservative and estimate the probability for all classes to have non-missing data. We will then use the method of bootstrapping (described below) to estimate a range for the probability value. We find that the class is not significant in about 14% of the sample. We could estimate a new probability for all of the classes and call it P = P(P(t|t |t)) for any value of t. Thus we have no way to know (with certainty) what the probability value is for a random class. We have no way to determine whether this is a true probability value.\n\nSome problems that could arise are noted below.\n\nClassifier based on some known classes (as proposed here) can have certain strengths and weaknesses. We have discussed several below. For instance, the problem that the proposed method cannot easily adapt to data from different domains is problematic, as a classifier should be developed to cope with the changing domain. Similarly, the fact that the test is not trivial is considered by some to be problematic. There is a wide variation in the complexity classes and their distribution in nature\n\nOther than this issue discussed previously, there are also some weaknesses associated with classifier-based classifier approaches, described below.\n\nThese weaknesses, however, are not specific to any single proposed solution that is used in this paper. As above, there are several other proposed classifier based methods (such as the random forest method) that share many of the weaknesses described in the paper.\n\nAnother proposed classifier-based method is to use a classifier based on the clustering function in [9]. This function can be used for clustering an ensemble of classes. Using clustering function based on classification task and k -fold cross-validation, we can create a single classifier, like the ones suggested in the paper (see S2 Table) and which can be tested on both known and unknown data (see above). Of course, the function used in this paper is specifically a clustering function, it does not scale well for example across data types.\n\nAlthough this method can result in a more flexible classifier, it is not as suitable as the ones mentioned above. It is possible to improve its flexibility by using multi-class clustering, clustering the classes by their distribution rather than on the number of classes.\n\nAnother proposed classifier-based test is similar to the ones used in the paper. However, the proposed method in [4] uses an arbitrary decision tree, whereas in [3] the proposed method used asymptotic method which are used by most existing classifiers. If a test like that proposed in [3] can be done reasonably well, even on known and unknown data sets, how much improvement can be achieved if instead, a decision tree is used which will be better suited for unknowns?

The rate for pedestrians is roughly 4, but for drivers it is 1.2--a significant gap. According to a 2006 study, over 80 percent of people believe they would have avoided an accident if they had been riding with their car. But that's not how it works. According to a study presented at the American Institute of Safety, less than 1 percent of people know how to properly check their car. This means that, the study concludes \"even the best trained drivers are still liable to get into accidents without even realizing, which could endanger them or others on the road.\" ( Source\n\nFor more interesting statistics and statistics, check out the following pages:\n\nFlu Shot Statistics for Kids and Teens\n\nFlu Shot Statistics for Children", "label": 1, "id": 100171}
{"text": "I have bought the complete season of Surface. watched it twice. One thing I have noticed, the games are usually not long enough and not enough information is shown. I found the second one to be much better in terms of information given from game to game. The one downside to the Xbox 360, is it cannot access the web when playing Halo 3 or 4.\n\nI also bought an old Xbox 360 and I decided to make it my main gaming device. I was able to use it pretty much as I did before the Xbox and the Xbox 360. All of my old games work on the old Xbox. I play most of my games with a keyboard and mouse from Halo 1 to Halo 3.\n\nConclusion\n\nXbox One is a great game console for those who like the play more games and enjoy video games but it also has its issues such as not having the same quality of graphics from its predecessor that it has now or having the same graphical flaw that will not cause a problem for those who have an older display in their house (720p or lower resolution). Its not the game console for all gamers. For some it will be a better gaming device that is much more affordable and will fit in their budget.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy playing games on my Xbox 360 and enjoy watching videos on Hulu. I am also enjoying the Xbox 360 games I've bought over on eBay. When I do my research for the best game consoles for sale, most of my picks are Xbox and I've found the Xbox 360 to be more affordable as well.\n\nTo any of the Xbox fans who want to go back to Xbox 360 and buy a game console for the first time. Here are some things to consider\n\nThis is the Xbox 360 version of the console. It is the same game console that was released in November of 2008 but now it runs for 10 years. In regards of memory, the Xbox 360 has 512MB of memory compared to the Xbox One's 2GB memory memory, with Xbox 360 games being on average 6 GB in size. For that reason, Xbox 360 console games are more expensive.\n\nI believe most Xbox One gamers will also upgrade to an Xbox One S if they are going to install the game console on their new console. They will also know that they will save money if they get their game console from Amazon for around $200 and the Xbox 360 sold for only $130 before.\n\nIf you are not a gamer then you can go back to an Xbox 360 and buy a $60 Xbox One at Amazon and if you are able to save more than $60. Check out our Xbox 360 Buyers Guide to see some good deals on the Xbox 360. Make sure to keep it in mind while buying your console.", "label": 1, "id": 100172}
{"text": "the present study aimed at analyzing the genetic variability of male and female participants and the population of the Haida Nation. The sample of Haida individuals was derived from the Haida Gwaii region (33\u00b010'S, 143\u00b000'E) on the southern coast of B.C. (Fig. 1), which has an estimated population of 25,700 (28,200 male and 7,500 female) people. The Haida Nation is a self-described indigenous group of approximately 600 to 8,000 people based on the Haida Gwaii area.\n\nWe conducted three analyses of DNA polymorphisms within the OCA4 gene: (i) the whole-genome microsatellite genotype, which is an unbiased quantitative measure of the population variation in alleles that encode the four OCA4 genes; (ii) an uniparental (MZ) panel of one male and one female sibling per participant in each pair; and (iii) a pairwise-phenotype analysis, which involved sequencing the entire genome for each individual, testing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels and/or substitutions. The study used autosomal genealogies to identify two genetic clusters of OCA4 variant alleles that showed substantial differences between male and female individuals in the study area (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nView largeDownload slide Fig 1.

{"text": "In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in 2004 that the term \"company\" may include a group of a single person and, if so - a \"co-operative association\" (G.Z. v. P., 2004, 11 EHRR 1).\n\nWhile the courts in Switzerland do not seem to define these entities in relation to the other two categories, they do hold that the existence of a company does not necessarily confer rights arising from ownership and/or the use of property. Furthermore, in the event that one of these entities does acquire a number of shares, only those shares that the group members are obligated to use - and not all of them - may be given away.\n\nWhen does the term \"group\" mean the group of several persons, i.e. an independent association, or a group of organizations (as in the case of a bank)?\n\nIn such cases, all the members of the group are considered to be members of the group regardless of whether in the context of the entire association or of some of its parts. This concept is referred to as the \"general rule\" or \"common rule\" of the law of associations (Articles 1.1 and 4.3 of the Swiss Constitution).\n\nHow are associations dissolved?\n\nA number of ways are available to entities that wish to dissolve, including dissolution through dissolution proceedings (see the Swiss Administrative Code, article 46), termination of existence (see Art. 28 of the Swiss Civil Code and Art. 15 of the Associations (Bundeskriminaliteitsdienst) Ordinance), or expropriation (see Art. 41 of the Swiss Civil Code and Art. 21 of the Swiss Administrative Code).\n\nHow are corporations incorporated?\n\nThere may be several ways to incorporate an association. The most common way is through a pre-legalization authorization (article 12.3 \"Pre-legalization\"). This can be accomplished by an amendment to the existing association's bylaws containing a provision that the current association, should it exist, is dissolved in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Government (this requirement is only effective if the Federal Government approves the amendment).\n\n\nAn alternative method is to incorporate an association together with another entity on the basis of an international association agreement or, even more frequently, an international association charter. In this case, the pre-legalization authorization requirement is removed and there are no further requirements to ensure the continuity of the associations' activities, other than the requirement to conduct meetings on a particular date.\n\n\nA second alternative can be enacted in the event of certain circumstances that constitute an impairment of a company's independence. In this case, the Swiss Administrative Code applies. There is a requirement where an association is incorporated in a foreign country that it may be subjected to \"foreign takeover\" or \"foreign takeover\" actions and where, in the event of the merger or acquisition of a competitor, it cannot act unilaterally. However, other considerations, such as the need for the new entity to be able to fulfil it's role as an economic entity, must determine such actions when both of these are considered to be relevant to the success of the merger or acquisition. Additionally, the law of Swiss administrative law also provides that an established association is exempted from paying the corporate tax.\n\n\nWhen does an association change ownership?\n\nWith the acquisition of a part of the group's assets, the remaining members of the group may, in certain circumstances, also change ownership. Such cases are addressed in the chapters below.\n\nWhat is the difference between an association and an independent association?\n\nThe basic concept here is similar and even closely related. On the one hand, an association is a legal entity that has come into being as a result of the combination of a single person and/or the other members of the association. It may also include other types of legal entities (collectives), such as companies or partnerships, that are used exclusively by the members of both the same- and separate-associations. An independent association is a legal entity with a separate status and which has not been a member of any association, or with only one person as a member. It may operate as a private company or a public corporation; it cannot be combined with other legal entities in any way so as to form a new entity.\n\n\nIs an association required to apply a minimum shareholding requirement?\n\nYes. A minimum shareholding requirement of 10% must always be applied. It is also obligatory for an association to appoint a corporate financial officer.\n\n\nThe association is a legal entity with a separate status, not the same as a private company. It cannot be combined with other legal entities in any way.\n\nWhat restrictions are imposed on the activities of independent associations in Switzerland?\n\nIn certain circumstances, the rules laid down in the Swiss Administrative Code (Articles 1.1 and 4.3) apply to independent associations. The law of associations provides similar restrictions to those applied to business firms.\n\n", "label": 1, "id": 100174}
{"text": "paradoxes in the impact dynamics of rigid bodies are known, and the impact time-dependence of the velocity is often determined with respect to the inertia component and the impact force. A major problem in the interpretation of these studies is the difference in body mass and in the impact force used in relation to the impact velocity. In the previous discussion it was shown that the mass of a rigid body acting on the Earth, from the point of view of its momentum, is the square of the impact velocity. In general, the impact effects on the body depend on both the mass and the impact distance. Therefore, some authors have tried to use the mass when they analyze the impact effects on the body and others have used the impact velocity. In this respect, Newton's second law may be used. The impact force, according to Newton's second law, is equal to the product of the mass multiplied by the impact velocity. The mass of the solid body, the impactor, depends only on the mass but also on its impact velocity. In order to calculate the impact force, it is necessary to determine the impact velocity as a function of the contact and impact distance. Also, it may be found that the mass of the rigid body acts as a constraint in order to obtain the collision velocity in the free fall condition.", "label": 1, "id": 100175}

{"text": "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, and want to know who invented it. In the Middle Ages it was a typical term - it was in the Bible after all, and it made quite a bit of sense and was clearly used in various contexts in the Middle Ages. But in recent decades a number of authors have claimed that the word dates back to the 9th or 10th century in Arabic or Greek, and it's only recently that historians have found a precise date for the first usage - a date that is far older than the Latin root. This has led to a number of \"Avenir\" accounts that claim that the word originates with the Islamic word arf or araf or arafr, and that the first use in French dates back to the time of the Prophet Mohammad or even much earlier, although it's generally agreed that the word was coined in the early 13th century. But it's not quite that simple.\n\nFirst, arf is not the direct translation of the Hebrew word \"arif\", but rather refers to a group of birds (the genus Cercopithecinae) native to the Near East. In Arabic, the word arf was an early form of the word \"arf\" or ar-f (\"for the sky\"). In the Quran, for example, the Quran has an interesting reference to the arf in this verse [Quran 9:26] as well as several other passages: \"The face of your Lord is above the highest heaven-heaven.\" And \"But they refuse, in order that thou shouldest say to them \"You ask a lie.\" Say: verily Allah hath created you from dust\" (the arf refers to the earth and heaven and is used as a plural form).\n\nThe Arabic root of arf is rahf, a word that had previously been used in an unrelated context in the same connection: the Arabic word is related to that used in the noun form of \"rajf\", an Arabian term which refers to the first two letters of the Hebrew word (with the suffix zaf) and means \"prince\", \"ruler\", \"lord\". So it was not difficult to understand how the Arabic word arf (which meant the sky, etc) from the Arabic word rahf (which meant \"prince\") could become a term with the same meaning.\n\nIndeed, several words with the same meaning have already been used in Arabic before the Arabic word arf ever entered the lexicon. For instance \"rahfah\" - \"prince\" or \"ruler\" (which has also been used in Egyptian to denote a kind of deity) refers to the Arabic king Abu Jahfar. Another Arabic word with the same meaning (which is related to the Hebrew word arf) is al-Rasool, which has been used in Arabic since the 7th century for the Arabic word for \"king\". Indeed, the same root has been extended to English, as \"araf\" or \"arr\" (which also means \"prince\") has been used to designate the ruler of Egypt from the 9th century, to the Roman emperor Vespasian, to the Greek and Roman emperors Vespasian, Vespasian I, Titus (both of whom were the most powerful kings of antiquity) and the later Byzantines who took Constantinople. So there's every reason to believe that the word arf in this context was already in common use long before the 14th century.\n\nBut other linguistic arguments can be raised, too, which make the idea that the Arabic arf was actually translated from Hebrew into French seem less likely. There is no clear evidence that the Hebrew arf referred to a bird or something else non-bird. A number of theories can be devised on this subject (and a bit of research will reveal there is at least one other theory), but there is nothing so compelling to suggest that \"referring to the sky\" is an example of a homonym that could easily be used in languages with different root words. At least none of the arguments seem to be based on the idea that the two words are mutually intelligible to begin with, as there are several languages that have both words and no word that translates to \"the sky\" in the English language.\n\nFor example, Spanish has a word that means \"the sky\" (luna), which has a meaning related to the Hebrew word arf, and also has its own origin of Latin arbo, related to the Greek word arbos. But there are other words used for \"the sky\" in Spanish, such as \"el rolo\", which is essentially the same thing as German Reisen, Latin rei and Greek kyrios (a common word in ancient Greek that means \"sky\"). Spanish already had one word on the lexicon that referred to the sky, which could be interpreted as something close to the Arabic arf, but it was not", "label": 1, "id": 100177}
{"text": "Standing in line at Starbucks, customers are presented with an icon by their name (called a \"star\") that they will be able to tap to open their order. Starbucks says the new system is faster and requires less user interaction than the one it replaced in 1995.\n\n\"Starbucks is always looking to build new ways to make our customers' lives easier,\" said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. \"The first steps toward that goal for us were the introduction of Tap & Go at our stores in the fall of 2015. Our goal is to continue evolving using new ways of thinking and using real-world application in our stores to make shopping through our service more convenient and entertaining than ever.\"\n\nThis new system allows for easier order processing and faster return service, while at the same time simplifying customer use by reducing unnecessary steps and complexity, and simplifying how items are displayed on the screen for ease of use.\n\nThe new system is rolled out this week in three new markets and expands to 13 other cities by the end of the year.\n\nThe new system also includes features that allow customers to quickly scan barcodes on their smartphones using the smartphone tap-and-pay feature. In the future, these features will allow customers to scan barcodes that are automatically uploaded to Starbucks's mobile app, as well.\n\n\"Tap & Go adds more than a little bit of magic,\" Schultz said. \"Tap & Go is not something new. Our customers are already familiar with scanning a barcode with a mobile device. For them, this new feature just adds an even smoother shopping experience. There is no additional equipment being used and there is no separate app needed on their phone.\"\n\nThe new platform will offer improved customer service, Schultz said, along with new and improved products and services.\n\nFaster service\n\nTap & Go allows customers to save orders to their phone, rather than having to pull out their wallet or purse, giving them the chance to have them ready on top of a drink, and be ready to eat shortly after.\n\nAfter customers place an order at a Starbucks store, they can select the option to save their order for later. When an order for a drink is completed, it can then be instantly scanned at any Starbucks store. Customers don't even have to leave the store to save their order.\n\nTap & Go also creates a more exciting shopping experience by offering new merchandise options. Today, customers can place orders with any selected product as a gift for some one in the house.\n\nThe new service brings together Starbucks customers who are regulars who take advantage of the company's Tap & Go offer on a daily basis, and also those who only make purchases once or twice a year. In total, Starbucks estimates that there are more than 800,000 mobile order-receiving accounts, according to CEO Schultz.\n\nOrder-receiving orders can provide a better shopping experience as it gives customers the experience of ordering things in the place they like, but not the place they need. Starbucks Tap & Go makes this experience possible for all customers, regardless of age and location.\n\nStarbucks hopes the new digital ordering system will be a more pleasant one for everyone, Schultz said.\n\nA faster shopping experience\n\nTap & Go will also help Starbucks offer a superior shopping experience to its customers. Customers will receive a prompt when a new product is available and their orders are delivered to them the moment they need them. This will make shopping for a gift more convenient and allow staff to get back in the queue faster.\n\nThe new digital ordering process will be used in all U.S. and Canadian stores. Starbucks employees will be on hand to guide customers through the new interface that Starbucks plans to unveil in the coming months. Schultz said store managers are \"pretty excited\" to work with Starbucks to deliver customer experience enhancements to the customer.\n\nThe new system will continue being rolled out in many other countries around the world throughout 2016.\n\n\"Our new mobile ordering system will mean we offer better customer service around the world. We have been able to expand our digital and mobile services and products to more than 800,000 people every day. As we roll these out, we hope that our customers will have a greater sense of ownership and ownership of our brand,\" Schultz said.\n\nStarbucks says it has already begun working with customers to make Tap & Go even faster. When it was introduced in retail stores last fall, it was implemented using a mobile ordering app on a smartphone and mobile checkout (through the Starbucks mobile app). The new electronic system is being rolled out to Starbucks locations throughout the world using a mobile app.", "label": 1, "id": 100178}

{"text": "Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian (the word is Chilian) who turns to crime. His mother dies of a cerebral hemorrhage, and his father hires an Italian man (Paul Sorvino) to impersonate his mother and arrange an anonymous sale of the property they share. His father gets his way, but before long there's trouble when his son is kidnapped by the mob. The resulting spaghetti Western has a number of familiar elements, but if you compare it to most movies about the same subject -- such as the original version of \"The King of Comedy,\" one of the most beloved movies of the '20s -- the differences are even more pronounced. The plot doesn't revolve around a high-powered hitman who can kill three men in four seconds; the character of the hitman is just to be used as a plot device. What follows are five hours of a group of characters who spend the main two thirds of the film being chased by various bad guys. But even so, \"The King of Comedy\" is a much better movie than \"The Godfather.\" The acting is much improved. There's no way John F. Kennedy could have played Uncle Sam or the mobsters. Still, the main difference between the movies is how they deal with a family relationship that has become a major part of American pop culture. The \"Godfather Saga\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" are filled with betrayals, fights, betrayals, fights, and yet they somehow become more gripping with each new act. \"King of Comedy\" is something else again. There's no reason for these people to be evil. They are just trying to protect their family in their own way. The movie also shows how important the family is at both its worst and its best. The death of a child or sibling is as big a trauma as the birth of a child. It's hard to deal with those situations when you never know if you will ever see your own child again. The story in \"King of Comedy\" shows the lengths to which parents will go to protect their children -- even when that means putting themselves in danger. It's an emotional story that should appeal to anyone who has had their family torn apart; for most people, having a child hurt or killed is something they can never forget. The best way to think of the movie is as a form of psychotherapy. Watching it puts you in the mindset of the people from the middle of the movie, as they go through the process without really knowing why. The ending suggests a kind of happy ending in which the family survives. The point of viewing it, then, is for you to discover what that happy ending might look like for your own family. That would probably be something much worse -- a sad ending.", "label": 1, "id": 100180}

We then consider a set Y consisting of these distributions \u03a6, and a subset S\u2032 that is composed of S, all pairs of distributions described between the other two sets. We then perform the following generalization of the simplex method: Let L 1, L 2, \u2026 correspond, respectively, to L 0, L 1, L 1, L 2, \u2026 L 3, \u2026 L 5, \u2026 of S. We define a sample of \u03bc, \u03bc\u2032, \u03bc' and \u03bc\u2032\u2032 to be the subset U (U\u2032, \u03bc') and U\u2032\u2032 (U\u2032\u2032, \u03bc) respectively, in all of the subsets S\u2032 (S) in \u03a6, \u03bc\u2032, \u03bc\u2032\u2032, \u03bc\u2032\u2032\u2032, and \u03bc\u2032\u2032\u2032. We then define a set of samples given by the pair of \u03a6, \u03bc', and \u03bc\u2032\u2032, and also by the pair of \u03bc\u2032, and \u03bc\u2032\u2032. This set is (U, \u03bc, \u03bc\u2032, \u03bc\u2032\u2032, \u03bc\u2032\u2032\u2032, \u2026), that is to say, a simplex of all of the samples. Figure 2 shows the representation of a sample of 10,000 values of \u03b1 \u03b2 from S: it has 5,000 elements divided into 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 subgroups, and each subgroup has its own name.

The first five subgroups are all of the form \u03c8 0 \u03c8 \u03c8 1. With just this sample, the set of samples is (2,4), (3,6), (4,0), (5,0), (0,2), which would correspond to a simplex of all the samples. In contrast, the sample of \u03c8 1 \u03c8 0 \u03c8 \u03c8 1 is in fact an empty set. This is because we have generated a set \u03c8 \u03c8\u2032 with 0 elements (the empty set).

{"text": "If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this makes sense. The past was a chaotic and disordered place where the law was often out of step with what it meant to the people who lived there. The present is a law-governed place, where the rules of the game are clearer, and the old rules haven't disappeared.\n\nBut in the early 1900s, this changed dramatically. During the first decade of the 20th century, the United States was going through a period that we now refer to as the Progressive Era. At this time, there was a concerted effort to make the legal system more functional and civilized.\n\nThese changes didn't happen all at the same pace. Progressive reformers had been writing laws on the topic of crime for centuries. However, while they were writing these laws in the early decades of the 20th century, many of them were written while crimes were still happening. This was because people were still feeling angry and fearful about crimes of the past, and so they couldn't let their frustration become a reality\u2014or they wanted to maintain a certain level of fear\u2014by being honest about the actual risk they faced.\n\nOne law, the crime and punishment section of the 1896 Omnibus Crime Bill, did just that. It made the public more aware of the threat that criminals posed.\n\nTo quote Slate, \"In the 1890s, the public had largely come to accept the idea that crime, not a lack of social opportunities, led to social ills. The 1893 \"Popular Science Monthly\" explained that \"the causes of crime will be found in the social condition of men; and the cause of reform will be found in their social condition.\" Many people wanted to believe that all people were made unequal by circumstances and bad upbringing. They might not have realized in the 1890s just how unequally they were made\u2014\"as the public understanding of the cause of crime grew,\" the paper noted in 1898, \"there grew the desire to provide for relief.\" In other words, people began to feel that they needed to do something about the crime problem and get back to a better social position, which was a pretty radical thought in 1893.\n\nTo help them with this goal, the bill created \"The Chicago Crime Commission\" to address crime. It was tasked with researching and determining which crimes actually occurred in the city. (In most parts of the country, statistics on crime were compiled by local authorities, which meant that crime statistics could change drastically from year to year.)\n\nThe commission went about gathering this data. As the report says, many of the problems that people identified with crime were already present in many parts of the country. For example, in many parts of the country, people had witnessed violent deaths at the hands of police. As a result, many were convinced that police were the cause of police crime. As the report states: \"The commission is of the opinion that criminal justice as now practiced in the United States is essentially a police matter.\"\n\nWhile the commission was investigating police crimes, it also investigated the crimes that happened on the other side of police officers. So for example, it discovered that during the period of 1893-1897, a great many people in Chicago were the victims of \"vagrancy,\" which it categorized as \"unlawful and immoral conduct in the home.\" During this period, they were arrested without actually being given a hearing and then sent to jail. They had to pay fine to be released, which they had to pay in cash or credit. On a positive note, people were allowed to have food and shelter in their homes.\n\nOf course, in other parts of the country, police were responsible for the criminal justice system. So while the commission was investigating a particular type of crime, it was also investigating how the people themselves were being punished.\n\nThis was one of the most significant aspects of the story: how the federal government, with the help of local communities, were using the tools of the law to create order. It was also a kind of \"backlash\" against the \"new social order.\" Just as those opposed to the New Deal were using the \"old order\" to attack the New Deal, those in support of reform were using modern technology to battle a new social order. Technology was used to solve problems that had plagued the people for centuries and created an urgency to create new order.\n\nWhile the \"popular understanding\" of crime of the first decade of the 20th century might sound pretty simple to most people, it really wasn't. There were many \"law and order\" campaigns taking place at the time. In other words, they were advocating for a way of life that wasn't quite what most Americans wanted.\n\nThe phrase \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\" wasn't coined in 1893, but it actually comes up quite often during these discussions of social order. These campaigns were based on things like a desire to clean up the streets and create more law and order. In fact, the", "label": 1, "id": 100182}

{"text": "background : assessing educational environment is vital in determining the likelihood of student success at college. With this in mind, we tested the theory that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes. To test we examine six individual-specific measures of instructional quality in college institutions. This study also explores the relative importance of factors important to students' academic success. We find significant differences by race, gender, and socioeconomic differences among students who attended the same college institutions. We also find that college teachers may have powerful policy implications for how students are educated in the United States. Our findings suggest that our current approach to educational equality may not be optimal.\n\nThe findings reported in this paper are based on aggregated data derived from a nationally representative sample of 8,500 students enrolled at more than 1,300 college institutions across the U.S. We tested a theory that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes.\n\nThe literature on student motivation and performance suggests that a weak sense of belonging in school is correlated with negative academic outcomes.4 Students' sense of belonging is strongly related to whether they feel a sense of personal investment in being academically successful. Students enrolled in academic programs with low teacher quality are less satisfied with their academic achievements, and more likely to engage in substance use.\n\nIn previous work, we have found evidence for the connection of teachers' motivation to student outcomes.5 Further work is needed to define the effects of teachers' motivation on student outcomes. The question we address in this study is whether the motivational effects of teachers on student achievement are important for students' educational success.\n\nHow does teachers' motivation affect students' academic performance? We have long been aware of the relationship of student achievement with teacher motivation,6 and there is evidence from past research that increases in teacher motivation increase academic achievement, but also that higher levels of teacher motivation have an adverse effect on academic achievement by increasing nonacademic achievement (such as emotional competence).7 There is evidence across disciplines8 that a higher level of educator motivation is associated with high student achievement.\n\nThe importance of motivated teachers is also supported in recent research on educational outcomes.9,10 However, there is debate about whether the link between teacher motivation and achievement is causal. Some scholars argue that the connection between teacher motivation and students' achievement can be the result of students' achievement, rather than their motivation.11 Others, however, contend that the link between teacher motivation and student achievement is important. A recent review of this literature and a subsequent study (Dixon and Rimer 2013) found little evidence of the link between teacher motivation and student achievement. However, research using measures of teacher motivation to assess student achievement12 supports the notion that teachers with high levels of motivation are better teachers.\n\nThe role of motivation and other factors relevant to student achievement is often overlooked in research on educational disparities. Many researchers have examined whether race/ethnicity is a major factor in factors important to student achievement,13 but have often overlooked the importance of student motivation.14 Because many researchers have found that achievement measures (such as standardized test scores) can be correlated with other factors important to students' educational outcomes\u2014e.g., family income, family composition\u2014it is important to investigate the role of student motivation as an important factor for students' academic outcomes. Given the importance of teachers' motivation in shaping student achievement, we have proposed that teacher motivation should be a key variable to measure in order to identify which areas of the educational environment affect student achievement.\n\nOur findings are based on aggregated data of individual-specific indicators of educational environment that were collected at eight participating colleges or universities in 2003, 2008, and 2011. We tested a hypothesis that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes. We were interested in the predictive power of six individual-specific indicators of educational environment: (1) student discipline referrals, (2) student absenteeism, (3) student persistence, (4) student academic effort, (5) student emotional competence, and (6) student academic self-efficacy.\n\nWe examined student outcomes on the basis of four measures: student academic achievement outcomes, student well-being outcomes from a widely used measure of personal well-being, student absenteeism outcomes, and student persistence measures. Student achievements at any given college are expected to be correlated with student outcomes from similar colleges; accordingly, we expected to find correlations with student achievement on these four measures. If teacher motivation had an important effect on students, those students who had more motivation (i.e., higher levels of teacher motivation) should have higher achievement outcomes than those who did not.\n\nHow much of the student achievement difference among students is the result of motivation? We asked students whether their overall academic achievement improved or worsened on the final exam for their honors English course as a function of having been told by a teacher that \"Teachers who do a better job and teach more effectively are likely to work harder and score higher on the final exam\" (Table 1", "label": 1, "id": 100184}
{"text": "a prime objective of welfare state activities is to take care of the poor. But the government's own census estimates show that poverty has become worse, not better, since 1980. The proportion of urban Indians who are below the poverty line has more than doubled in the last 20 years. Even a cursory glance at the census reveals the extent to which the poor have been made to suffer. As a result, the poor have become less and less willing to cooperate with the state. \"The poor will always want more and more and we have to give it to them,\" says a top bureaucrat, who did not want to be identified. It is a view shared by Narendra Modi, the new Prime Minister, who has made all his economic speeches off the cuff. \"The poor have a hunger for jobs, an appetite for education and a thirst for better health services,\" he has said. But there can be no such hunger, at least not if the new government is going to do its job properly. A more fundamental aim of the NDA government appears to be not to help those in most need, but to help the upper middle class. The government is likely to continue pushing for the universalization of education; it will take a lot less of the poor's money to spend on them than on the poor. There is little evidence that India's economic growth has been powered by the poor. Instead, the poor have had their jobs, or been helped out of poverty by the government. And for the middle classes, the growth has been far more subtle. As we saw, the government has been using its financial muscle to offer rich people a deal: if you let the government use up your tax-exempt status on your houses or businesses for a set period of time, you can invest more in India. It is the \"grand bargain\". \"The poor will always want more and more and we have to give it to them,\" says a top bureaucrat. His words, however, are hollow if he actually believes that the poor will put more money in his pockets, and not the tax-exempt house he will be able to buy. And even if he were right, this would only make things worse. The rich are not exactly starving; they are only suffering from the government's failure to provide them with affordable housing. A report published by Credit Suisse estimates that housing across the country is worth $1.1 trillion and it is this that will drive the growth of India's economy in the years ahead. Given that the rich have so much money at stake, what are the priorities of the government for making sure that the poor are helped the most?\n\nIndia's economic growth has been driven by the expansion of private housing.\n\nIt is also easy to see why India has seen such strong growth without the government's help. The government has spent over $300 billion (Rs 6.3 trillion) on infrastructure \u2013 roads, power plants, hospitals and so on. This was a lot of money when housing, education and health were relatively simple undertakings that could be paid for through cash transfers with a decent return to the recipients. Most of this capital investment does not look so impressive on paper but the benefits that it brings over the long term, such as cheaper food, cleaner air and cleaner water, are inestimable. In the last decade or so, however, the costs of this infrastructure spending have been mounting (see chart 1). The government could also have invested far more in public infrastructure. In the private sector, this means building new factories, roads and airports. But in India, the government has spent only a fraction of what it could have. Private companies that have used public projects as a pretext to shift factories abroad have been rewarded handsomely with easy tax exemptions. Even with low-cost borrowing, firms are only able to finance one private sector project in India at a time. The result is that even with government help, private companies can't invest much more. And the result is that the country has struggled with the very real problem of high levels of unemployment. In the past decades, the government paid huge subsidies to encourage manufacturing in India but this has proven to be a massive blunder. The cost of capital that was used in India has soared above the cost of production. Because of this, Indian manufacturing suffers from underinvestment. In 2014, for example, companies in the auto sector employed 8.8 million workers. But that is still only 16% of India's workforce. In a country as large as India, however, where is the government's incentive to encourage the creation of jobs? The answer may be that it has long been dead. The World Bank is, again, right in its assessment of India's development model. It says that India has the largest number of people in the world earning over $1.25 a day, a figure that has remained largely static over the past five years. And it is the lowest number of people in Asia which has also remained virtually unchanged over the past five years. India's gross domestic", "label": 1, "id": 100185}

In this case, there was good preservation of brain stem function, but there is also evidence that myocardial ischemia contributed to the patient's cardiac arrest. In an age of high-intensity cardiac output with a small window of survival, it is critically important to determine the extent of the contribution of myocardial ischemia to this patient's recovery.\n\nOBJECTIVE To determine if prehospital rescue from cardiac arrest is possible in patients with asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or other heart failure and whether rescue can occur while the patient is using cardiac monitors.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three patients (median age 75 \u00b1 10 years, age range 22 \u00b1 1 to 92 \u00b1 13 years) with nonfatal acute cardiac arrest who were in general cardiac arrest (n = 39) and whose prehospital recovery status was categorized as cardiopulmonary failure, ischemia, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (n = 18) were included in this study. After a history and physical examination and a cardiac loop defibrillator or ventricular assist device were administered in one of three classes, patients were immediately resuscitated with the use of a coronary angiogram before any further monitoring. The cardiac monitors were maintained as the patients were moved to the operating room.\n\nRESULTS Of these 39 patients, nine were classified as being in the class of cardiopulmonary failure. Cardiopulmonary failure was defined as the absence of pulmonary artery dilation after 3 minutes of peak ventricular ejection fraction. It was defined by the presence of a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or electrocardiogram result. Of the 13 identified as having ventricular fibrillation, two (22%) were classified as being in the class of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia. Two patients (9%) in the class of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia survived to hospital discharge, and all patients had functional status.

This led directly to the Indian Act of 1860 which was so controversial that, though Parliament later repealed it, in 1861 the High Court of Appeal in Britain upheld it on the grounds that there was an 'imminent danger of the loss of life'.\n\nThe Indian Constitution\n\nOn 12 March 1857 this 'imminent danger of the loss of life' was realised when a mob stormed the office of the governor general and his wife and, at 3am, opened fire on what was left of the government before fleeing. This was the end of British rule in India. By March 1857 Indian armies had invaded parts of the old British Indian colonial power base, and, by mid-December the government in Delhi had been forced into making peace with the Sikhs at Amritsar \u2013 the only British surrender of its kind. By the time of his death on 1 March 1861 William Blake had written how Britain 'had lost her empire'. Yet no sooner had British rule ended that the Indian Union was formed in 1862 comprising the three British colonies of India, the Indian Protectorate of Punjab, and the British East India Company's Indian empire.\n\nThe Indian Union had a provisional government in the new Indian capital Calcutta (now Kolkata), but the main political bodies were controlled from Calcutta by the British East India Company, which retained its own seat at Lord's in London. The company itself was dissolved in 1894 and an independent Sikh state was formed, after its annexation of Punjab in 1921.\n\nIndian politicians, though not all Sikhs, considered the British Raj an unequal arrangement of unequal powers. For the British, though a far more powerful state, they were often viewed as little more than subjects under their rule. Sikhs, on the other hand, saw themselves as a distinct ethnic group and often considered themselves part of Hindu India (as were other smaller sub-groups such as the Tharu, the Brahmo, and others). The majority of non-British India was overwhelmingly Muslim but there were Sikh communities as well. The British had never been completely successful at assimilation, but they had found some way to make an agreement with India's most recent immigrants: the Sikhs. To gain their trust as a people the British allowed a substantial degree of personal liberty; but in return to the British the Sikhs were expected to contribute to the British empire and to abide by British law and regulations. They accepted that they would face discrimination and persecution by some of the more conservative elements of Indian society, but they believed that they could use their superior education and entrepreneurial skills to be a useful labour force. Though never a majority, they were at the forefront of the anti-Indian Upheaval and the movement by which British-backed politicians sought to overturn the Indian Raj by removing the Hindu emperor and his Hindu family.\n\nThe British Empire during the Sikh Rebellion\n\nThe British had, however, been unable to provide political prosperity in the new Indian Union on their own \u2013 a series of internal crises eventually forced their hand and the empire was ended in 1869 as the Empire once again came into being.", "label": 1, "id": 100187}

It is important to note that the index uses an \"all stock\" price index, so it is appropriate to consider the value of the assets held by each of the companies, and the value of their liabilities held.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, we are going to treat the \"average float\" value of the companies within the MSCI All Country World Index as equal to the sum of their current market capitalizations. Note that this excludes the MSCI's debt securities, because a company needs to earn at least 10% (to be included on the Index's \"real float\") on its net debt before it will be able to include the debt securities on the index, and so the real float is always lower than the average float value calculated with a 10% leverage.\n\nIn the charts below, we display the current market capitalization of companies in the MSCI All Country World Index, along with their current market cap, and their average float value. The size of the bubble at the beginning of each market cap is indicated by the size of the dot surrounding the dot (or larger for large stocks) and the extent of the bubble based on the extent of the bubble (or greater for large bubbles). The dots also correspond to the MSCI's index values. Companies will typically show negative and positive bubble sizes.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index (the blue dots) rose dramatically over the past two months, rising 22.25% compared to March 2nd. However, it is important to note that market capitalization data is subject to seasonal variation, and therefore market cap is a very imperfect measure of the health of these companies. To address that problem, we will also provide a monthly market cap chart of the index.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index shows a large price/earnings (P/E), dividend paid, and stock pay ratio bubble for the current month, with an index value of 7, with a bubble size of 21% (based on the entire market cap value, not just the current market cap).\n\nIn the case of MSCI, the dot color is based on the company's most recent stock price (which is very close to the average float value, and so the dot may not appear in a graph where the company's current float is not included).\n\nCompany Market Cap Float\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS 3,814,966 7,086,800\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF AMERICA 2,978,084 6,938,858\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CANADA 2,935,636 6,944,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF GERMANY 2,639,040 6,856,039\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF JAPAN 2,931,906 7,078,851\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF FINLAND 2,929,521 6,892,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF SWITZERLAND 2,921,738 7,043,850\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF LUXEMBOURG 1,847,732 6,878,894\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF SPAIN 1,848,664 6,892,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CZECH REPUBLIC 1,945,680 7,044,766\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF PORTUGAL 1,942,050 7,027,860\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF INDIA 1,886,930 5,995,086\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF IRELAND 1,884,240 7,045,074\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF UKRAINE 1,864,632 7,013,737\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF IRELAND AND CYPRUS 1,837,837 7,041,639\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF KOREA 1,834,829 6,863,883\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF UKRAINE 1,817,400 7,039,631\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CHINA 1,812,740 6,898,944\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES 1,734", "label": 1, "id": 100189}

{"text": "Oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of use that was based on anecdotal reports \u2014 not clinical research. The evidence is quite weak, which is a good reason for us to not allow the general media to make sweeping statements about \"pure\" or \"organic\" products.\n\nPesticides\n\nPesticides are often used in organic farming, and they are often also toxic. The main pesticides in organic farming are herbicides and fungicides (like organophosphates \u2014 a known neurotoxin). And they are often toxic to human beings who consume this organic food and produce.\n\nAnd here's another problem: The majority \u2014 perhaps 95% of the products that contain these and other pesticides, are simply labeled \"organic,\" but often they are not. This is a result of the failure in organic standards, whereby all of these chemicals are allowed to be in our food, without a comprehensive testing process for safety. But even if the regulations had existed, they still would not necessarily identify pesticides that pose a health or environmental hazard. They would just mean that it is safe and not harmful.\n\nHere's a link to more on the issue of pesticides in organic farming: http://www.ecologicalfoods.org/organic-farm-plants/chemicals/organic-pesticides-and-additives-dirt-pesticides.\n\nSo here are some other examples of pesticides that are found in some of the top rated organic products, in order of the amount of evidence in the evidence that pesticides are harmful to wildlife.\n\n1. Glyphosate\n\nMore than 160,000 pounds of glyphosate was sprayed on the crops on organic farms in the US in 2007, resulting in the massive increase of Roundup Ready genetically engineered corn and soybeans.\n\nThis chemical is a very powerful herbicide known to damage both plant and animal tissues. Studies indicate that Roundup Ready corn and soybeans are extremely resistant to glyphosate but resistant to others, like mirex, the most toxic of them all.\n\n2. Chlordane\n\nThe main chemical in the herbicide chlormethiazole is even more poisonous than glyphosate. It has a high LD50 (the dose that kills 50% of the test subjects), and is extremely toxic to aquatic animals, including fish, frogs and turtles. Chlorpyrifos is an herbicide which has been found in other organic foods as well, particularly with strawberries and blueberries. These plants are grown without the use of anything else except the herbicides, and are sprayed with chlorpyrifos \u2014 with chlorpyrifos being used as many as 2-3 times each growing season, or nearly daily. And I'm sure the USDA is also happy to spray these plants for free, so they could be used for the same goal \u2014 not to protect the environment, but to make our food taste that much better.\n\nChlorpyrifos also has an EPA category of \"Pesticide of Concern\", with residues of chlorpyrifos being found in a significant number of samples of fresh produce. This makes it a great pesticide to spray for pest control, and the USDA even says that \"its benefits outweigh its risks\" when it comes to controlling insects in gardens.\n\n3. Pyrethrum\n\nPyrethrum is a neurotoxin that is known to be dangerous for aquatic animals and humans who consume it in large doses. When it is sprayed and applied to our food and crops, it is also added to these pesticides for animal and human consumption. According to USDA, pyrethrum is used to \"control pests in animals (such as poultry) and to control insects in crops (hay, alfalfa). Pyrethroids are synthetic compounds containing natural products or pesticides. They were designed to provide higher concentrations than chemical pesticides. As a result, the natural part of the substance that was formerly naturally occurring, such as pyrethrum, is the predominant chemical in pyrethrum and in the products itself.\" So basically, just because we use this natural part of the natural product, does not make it safe.\n\n4. Gamma Oxides\n\nIn 2008, the EPA determined that there is concern regarding the potential adverse effects of gamma radiation on human health. Gamma radiation has been found in certain organic foods as well. While not listed as an organic pesticide on our labels, we are definitely eating these chemicals and we are probably also giving off some radiation from the food we eat, as the chemicals used are highly radioactive (and not organic, but it still hurts humans!).\n\n5. Pesticides Like Pesticides\n\nWe know that when certain pesticides are used, we can learn just enough about these products to begin to assume a harmful pattern. We know that genetically modified organism seeds are very beneficial to human health, yet, we use GMOs and they are widely labeled as organic, so you may never know they", "label": 1, "id": 100191}
{"text": "the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) is a dedicated telescope that is a perfect choice for astronomers. Built in the late 1970s by G. Stadelmann in his workshop, the instrument is a relatively simple but extremely useful instrument for both amateur and professional astronomers. As a G-ray telescope, imager has a focal length of 6.3 arcminutes, and its imaging resolution is about 0.7 \u00c5. By contrast, for comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope can only cover 10 to 20 arcminutes at its aperture. With these impressive numbers and aperture, a gpi image is very sharp, which makes it possible to obtain the kind of images that other spectrographs need to show. G-ray telescopes have a large aperture, as the name implies, and this allows for a lower power (lower energy) output and reduces the amount of light required to be focused. That, in turn, enables an image resolution (or signal to noise ratio) of about 1 \u00c5, which is much lower than what is typically possible with spectrographs. The resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope, for instance, can typically achieve about 1.5 \u00c5, while a typical resolution of gpi of 0.5 to 1.5 \u00c5 is common. Of course, the Hubble Space Telescope has twice as much money available (about 7 billion dollars in 2009), and could probably devote four or five times as much of its time and resources to this task!\n\nThe gpi telescope is mounted on the ground, with the camera's mirrors held in an open position above the telescope's optics. But its images are obtained by pointing the telescope directly at the scene, and by using the optics' correction features to correct for the distorted shape of the earth's surface and the Earth's atmospheric refraction. To produce the gpi images, the telescope's pointing is calibrated against a ground-based reference for the position and azimuth (horizontal and vertical) of the Earth and the Sun. Each gpi image is then imaged with two different filters. One such filter provides red wavelengths and the other provides blue wavelengths (i.e. ultraviolet). These filters are typically made and distributed by the manufacturer and are then applied specifically to the telescope's telescope mirrors. Thus, by adjusting the correction optics on the telescope mirrors by using the calibration filter on the camera lens for the correct positioning, astronomers can produce a wide number of gpi images with different wavelengths. In addition to its use as a spectrograph and as a G-ray telescope, the gpi is also very popular for use as a photography camera because it can produce high ISO images using a single exposure. For example, the NASA-funded Project Skyfusion uses G-prisms with high-ISO (ISO) film, and can capture very detailed images, especially in the blue and red wavelengths.\n\nFigure 1.

On this scale most of the ear can be fitted with the small earlobe, with the largest size earlobes being very rare. The earlobes are also one of the largest sensory features on the entire animal. On the other hand, the skull appears well-developed because the cranial bones seem well-adapted to support the skull, whereas the brain is found to be underdeveloped due to the small size of this tissue. The brain case is extremely short compared to the brain diameter and is in proportion to the body. The cranial bones (including the skull) have a small cross-section, while the brain shell is well-developed. The head and neck are well developed. In addition, the forelimbs are well developed. The limbs and all major body systems are well developed, except that the feet are lacking in size. There are approximately 30 ribs covering the entire body, with the ribs in proportion to the rest of the animal. The forelimbs have five toes, with large toes as well as small, flattened toes. The tail has four claws. The tailbone is in proportion to the head. The legs and feet are small, except for the forelimbs. The legs seem well-adapted to support the animal, due to minimal muscle and bone mass. These skeletal structures tend to resemble those of extant dinosaurs. The pelvis may be compared to that of extant birds, yet the ribcage is much smaller than that of a full-grown extant bird. Furthermore, a common feature is that the abdominal organs are much smaller then those of dinosaurs, thus a lack of abdominal cavities. Most dinosaurs were herbivores although plant eating forms are present on several of the groups. The small teeth are found in proportion to teeth in extant organisms. In addition, the teeth appear to be well adapted to the diet: they possess ridges on their surfaces for gripping plant material and the sharp corners are likely for cutting while in chewing motion. A number of the fossil specimens are preserved in articulation and some seem to be fossil mammals.\n\nThe bones of the pelvis and ribcage are of a different structure than those of living vertebrates. These bones were attached to other bones by ligaments or plates. These bones are well developed; for example, there are only four bones present in the pelvis that are at all similar to those in living vertebrates. However, the ribcage is shorter in both the cervical and thoracic vertebrae than it is in living vertebrates. These differences are also found in the foot bones. The forelimbs are very well developed; however, there are no digits, as the foot never formed the forelimb. The digits, at least, are present in both the feet; they are also found in most extant mammals (except perhaps fish). The hand bones are also relatively well developed, with digits at the tips. The ribs and forelimbs are not connected by ligaments as with living members of the Dinosauria, and therefore were highly adapted to survive harsh lifestyle and habitat changes.", "label": 1, "id": 100194}

{"text": "we searched a short - term radio variability in an abandoned industrial site on the outskirts of Salford. We did not expect such a big signal and were not sure why we were receiving it and what kind of signals could be generated by the station.The Salford site consists of a warehouse and a few small buildings. It's very far away from the urban area, more than 500m, and there have been some very strong solar activity bursts in the past few years but no radio detections.There have been a few attempts to listen for these, they are very rare indeed and have been known for some time to be random.\n\nWe have recorded lots of activity in the past on this frequency, most of it was due to solar flares and the bursts that were recorded in late 2014 and early 2015 were clearly solar flares.\n\nThe first burst was a very weak burst of light with a frequency around 1250kHz. It appeared from a distance of 3.5km away and for some reason we did not hear this burst again after the fact. At the moment we do not know why. At least we know from our previous work that an irregularity or \"sudden death\" has to be at least 500kHz and we have never seen such a sudden-death burst before. This could happen as a result of a sudden drop in an antenna's input or due to signal suppression by some artefact in the detector.\n\nBut the most interesting burst we've recorded is a strong radio burst - but again one we still do not understand. It arrived at the site at 1231 hrs but was too weak to be detected. It is almost definitely some kind of an echo, which is explained by the fact that the station has very strong signals in other frequencies. This means that even the lowest frequency is being transmitted through the earth's atmosphere.\n\nAfter this burst, we started trying to figure out whether there might be some kind of an acoustic wave that could be generated by the station from the same location. We investigated how the radio signals get to and from Salford from the site and discovered that the signal propagation from inside the old warehouse to the main building and back again takes some time. This means that in a situation where the station is still in use a few kilometres away there might be some kind of an acoustic signal coming out of it which is picked up by the satellite.\n\nWe now know that all these radio signals might be actually reflections of the signals that originate from the central tower of the old warehouse - and there should be lots of them. We're now trying to study the possible waveforms that these reflections might produce. One thing that seems quite clear now is that these signals are most likely coming from the central tower of the building.\n\nIt is known to radio enthusiasts that if a very strong radio signal travels at the speed of light then it will travel from the transmitter over distances greater than the speed of light - for example, the speed of light is nearly 186,000 miles per second. It might travel for billions of light-years or to within light-years of any point in the known universe.\n\n\nThis picture was taken on 20th October 2000 and shows a series of three bursts from Salford, which was last used by a very powerful radio power station (S2VUK Ltd, Salford, in 1996/97.)\n\n\nThe main building of the Salford Radio Station can be seen in the centre of the picture. This is the first photo to show the building in use and was shot on October 20th.\n\n\nWe have located a collection of interesting documents of various descriptions about the use of the building. The documents indicate that the site was put into operation in 1976. We see that the building was used to transmit from around 1986 and then abandoned after several years until 1995. The pictures show that a new tower was built and operating in 1997/8. An old sign appears to have been put on the wall next to the old building.\n\n\nAnother picture was taken on the roof - in the middle window it can be seen a blue sign, clearly showing that it was an antenna used to reach the new satellite base.\n\n\nA huge antenna covered with a thick green tarpaulin can be found next to the main entrance.\n\n\nThe building was fully occupied when Salford radio was last in production, but a new satellite base was added to it in 1997/8. The sign was taken down in 2003 after building work was done to a different satellite base. No further work ever took place on the building and it was declared surplus in 2007 by the company who owned it.\n\n\nThe station was still on the air in 2008 when an artist and videographer named Richard Jones was inside putting some camera's on the roof, when he discovered that this building was the main antenna to the satellite base and he filmed the view out over the site. He was then attacked again, taken from the roof and badly beaten. When Richard", "label": 1, "id": 100196}

The government has no need for your coal, no need for the iron ore, and no one needs your mining or iron ore. Everything is dead.\"\n\nSo, Mr. Harper is making his final stand.\n\nHe is still determined to continue the push for Keystone XL. It is still his top priority, even though it is already clear the project will not go ahead. He continues to oppose the Northern Gateway pipeline to the West Coast, even though it is still being finalized and TransCanada and Enbridge have agreed to drop the project with no further delay. He still believes the world will come to its senses before it is too late.\n\nThe final battle is already underway. The oil sands industry is bracing for two new federal laws in just over three months, both of which are being pushed by the Prime Minister's office. The first, a review into the approval process for liquefied natural gas, will be pushed forward by Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver. The second is the bill to speed up the review process for pipelines that could have both oil and natural gas in them.\n\n\"The Canadian business community is getting a bit nervous,\" says Mark Cameron of the Canadian Energy Research Institute. \"Our best guess is that they are seeing a real threat where there's really no threat.\"\n\nBut the pipeline lobbyists are not waiting. Industry groups are warning of the risk of the new laws to their business with oil and gas companies. They have also started to focus their attention on what remains of the Northern Gateway pipeline, which is still stuck in limbo.\n\nOn the eve of the Harper's first election, Peter Watson, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, made several highly publicized visits to Alberta, including attending a rally at which one participant made a sign that said \"Don't make Canada an oil exporting nation.\"\n\nWatson has made it clear the current situation with oilsands extraction and exporting is \"an unsustainable one,\" he says, and the Harper government must deal with it immediately.\n\nLast year, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers urged the federal government to abandon its plan to phase out coal-fired electricity, arguing it would cost the country $7.4 billion. Instead of focusing resources on the coal industry, it argued, the government should focus its efforts on renewable energy in order to help cut emissions and tackle climate change.\n\nBut oil-sands extraction and refining remains the primary industry in Canada, so environmental groups are calling for the government to act more swiftly to protect the environment.\n\nAs for the Keystone XL pipeline, some observers believe that the pipeline is already at death's door. The American oil and gas industry has already moved on. So, the pipeline could face delays even after it is approved for construction. The project has faced the usual threats from activists and even some of former Republican president George W. Bush's cabinet members.\n\nThe Harper government argues the pipeline will create thousands of jobs for people in Canada and that it will generate billions in revenue to the national treasury. Opponents have suggested as much as $16 billion would be lost annually if a leak were to occur.\n\nBut, in his speech, Harper noted these facts are easily disputed. He noted that construction on the oil pipeline project was already underway, and his government was already investing the money expected under the project proposal.\n\n\"Canada's decision about whether to proceed with this project is a decision for our government,\" Harper said. He noted the Conservative government still believes in the pipeline. \"Of course, when you do business with someone you expect to do things your way \u2014 and you do know that you need to pay attention to what's really happening in the world.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's Speech is delivered at the legislature in Ottawa.

However, six weeks after the surgery, the patient returned with a visual acuity of 20/200 and the silicone oil tamponade was found to have migrated to the anterior chamber of the eye. The patient was then scheduled for a second surgery to remove the silicone oil and replace it with gas c3f8 14%. After the exchange of tamponades, the patient's visual acuity began to improve steadily. At the 12-week follow-up, the patient's visual acuity had improved to 20/30, and optical coherence tomography revealed that the macular hole had closed. This successful outcome demonstrates the potential benefits of gas tamponade and the importance of closely monitoring patients with silicone oil tamponades.", "label": 1, "id": 100209}
{"text": "This is because at high altitudes, the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere is significantly reduced, leading to a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. In extreme cases, it can lead to unconsciousness and even death.\n\nSupplemental oxygen can help prevent or mitigate the effects of hypoxia by increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body. In mountain climbing, for example, it is common for climbers to carry portable oxygen canisters that they can use at high altitudes. Similarly, pilots of non-pressurized aircraft may use oxygen masks to ensure that they have enough oxygen to stay alert and focused during long flights.\n\nWhile supplemental oxygen can be a life-saving measure, it is important to remember that it is not a cure-all. Climbers and pilots still need to be aware of the risks of hypoxia and take steps to avoid it, such as acclimatizing gradually to higher altitudes or scheduling flights at lower altitudes whenever possible. Additionally, supplemental oxygen can be expensive and cumbersome to carry, so climbers and pilots must weigh the benefits and drawbacks carefully when deciding whether to use it.", "label": 1, "id": 100210}

{"text": "This means that the state of the quantum system is minimally disturbed by the measurement process, allowing for more accurate and precise measurements to be made. Weak measurements are particularly useful in situations where the system being measured is fragile or difficult to access, as the low level of back-action minimizes the risk of damaging or altering the system.\n\nIn addition to their practical applications, weak measurements have also played an important role in advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics. Through a careful analysis of the measurement results, weak measurements have provided new insights into the nature of wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, and the quantum nature of time.\n\nDespite their many benefits, weak measurements are not without their challenges. Because the strength of the measurement signal is so low, it can be difficult to distinguish true measurements from background noise. Additionally, the low signal-to-noise ratio can make it difficult to interpret the results of weak measurements, and to draw meaningful conclusions about the underlying quantum system.\n\nDespite these challenges, weak measurements remain an essential tool for scientists and researchers working in the field of quantum mechanics.

The use of cardiopulmonary bypass requires temporary cessation of the heart's function, which can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury, whereby the return of blood flow to the heart can cause additional damage. The use of anesthetics can also contribute to the stress response by altering the body's normal stress response mechanisms.\n\nTo minimize the effects of this stress response, surgeons and medical professionals frequently use techniques such as epidural anesthesia, which can reduce the need for general anesthesia and minimize the body's inflammatory response. Additionally, perioperative management of blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and fluid balance can help reduce the impact of physiological stress on the body.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to provide adequate postoperative care to patients to ensure that they recover quickly and completely. This may include monitoring for complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ dysfunction, as well as providing appropriate pain management and rehabilitation services.\n\nOverall, while cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is a complex procedure with numerous stressors for the body, careful management and monitoring of the patient can help minimize the negative impact of these stressors and improve outcomes for patients.", "label": 1, "id": 100218}
{"text": "The sequence of structures consists of quantum wells and quantum dots of varying thickness, which have been engineered to exhibit different behaviors concerning free carrier absorption and intersubband transitions. By analyzing the absorption spectra of these structures, it is possible to gain insights into the underlying physical processes that govern their behavior.\n\nIn general, it is found that thicker quantum wells exhibit a stronger free carrier absorption and weaker intersubband transitions, while the opposite is true for quantum dots. This can be explained by the fact that thicker quantum wells have a larger number of carriers available for absorption, while the confinement in quantum dots results in a stronger electron-hole interaction and hence a stronger intersubband transition.\n\nThese results have important implications for the design of semiconductor heterostructures for applications such as optoelectronics and quantum computing. For example, it suggests that quantum dots may be a better choice for devices that require efficient intersubband transitions, while quantum wells may be more suitable for applications that require high sensitivity to free carriers.\n\nOverall, this comparison of different structures provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between free carrier absorption and intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures, and highlights the importance of careful material engineering for achieving desired device behavior.", "label": 1, "id": 100219}

However, when disorder is increased, the electron-electron interactions are suppressed and the localization length is determined by the strength of disorder. This leads to a localization length that follows the 1/3 scaling relation. As the electron density is increased, the system undergoes a transition from a strongly interacting to a weakly interacting regime. This is accompanied by a crossover from the 1/2 to the 1/3 scaling behavior. Our results provide insight into the complex behavior of disordered systems and have important implications for the design and optimization of electronic devices using semiconductors.", "label": 1, "id": 100243}

{"text": "Despite advancements in medical technology and treatments, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a common cause of mortality worldwide. This condition affects the liver and can progress rapidly, leading to a series of complications that can ultimately result in death. The causes of HCC are numerous, including hepatitis B and C virus infections, chronic alcoholism, aflatoxin exposure, and metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). \n\nRegular surveillance and early detection are crucial in managing HCC. Imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI, liver function tests, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels can aid in diagnosis. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the cancer and may include surgery, liver transplantation, or other therapies such as ablation or embolization. \n\nPrevention is also critical in avoiding the potential development of HCC. Limiting alcohol consumption, avoiding contact with hepatotoxic chemicals, and obtaining appropriate vaccinations (e.g hepatits B and C) can help reduce the risk of liver cancer. In addition, managing underlying conditions such as NAFLD or metabolic syndrome through lifestyle modification or medication use may also be beneficial in preventing HCC. \n\nIn conclusion, although HCC remains a prevalent cause of mortality globally, it is preventable in many cases. Through proper surveillance, early detection, and preventive measures, people can significantly reduce their risk of developing this condition. Improved awareness and action can help curb the impact of HCC and save lives.", "label": 1, "id": 100245}

{"text": "Despite years of research, a conclusive understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms that trigger gi-mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) remains elusive. However, it is believed that several signal transduction pathways are involved, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. These pathways lead to the activation of various downstream effectors, such as the small GTPases, which are critical for the modulation of synaptic plasticity and the induction of LTD.\n\nAdditionally, studies have shown that changes in calcium ion influx, protein synthesis, and gene expression are also involved in gi-mGluR-dependent LTD. It is thought that calcium influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels is necessary for the activation of downstream signalling pathways. The subsequent activation of protein synthesis machinery is then required to promote the restructuring of synaptic connections that underlie LTD.\n\nOverall, while much progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying gi-mGluR-dependent LTD, much remains to be discovered.

This creates a significant demand for affordable housing, but, due to a lack of resources, there is simply not enough to go around.\n\nThe researchers further note that this shortage of affordable housing is having a ripple effect throughout the economy. As housing costs rise, people are forced to spend more and more of their income on housing, leaving less for discretionary spending. This, in turn, affects businesses that rely on consumer spending, leading to reduced economic growth and even job losses.\n\nIn addition, the researchers argue that the shortage of affordable housing is fueling segregation and inequality by pushing low-income individuals and families into neighborhoods with limited resources and opportunities. This segregation, they say, perpetuates poverty and limits upward mobility for those affected.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers recommend a combination of measures, including increasing the supply of affordable housing, raising the minimum wage, and implementing policies that promote more equitable distribution of wealth. Such policies, they argue, will not only benefit those struggling to find affordable housing but will also promote economic growth and social cohesion.", "label": 1, "id": 100279}

{"text": "With topspin networks, the directionality of the edges represents a spin vector that can be associated with a topological structure. The addition of this topological information to loop quantum gravity has significant implications for understanding the nature of space-time at very small scales.\n\nOne potential application of topspin networks is in cosmology, where they could potentially resolve some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of the universe. For example, by encoding topological information, it may be possible to detect the presence of cosmic strings - hypothetical, one-dimensional topological defects in space-time that are predicted by some models of the early universe.\n\nAnother potential application is in quantum computing, where topspin networks could be used as a platform for developing topological quantum computing. Topological quantum computing is a novel approach to quantum computing that relies on the manipulation of topological states rather than quantum states, and has the potential to be much more resilient to errors.\n\nOverall, the extension of loop quantum gravity to include topspin networks represents an exciting area of research that has the potential to shed new light on some of the most fundamental questions in physics. By encoding topological information in spin networks, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of space-time at very small scales, and potentially develop new technologies and applications based on the principles of topological quantum computing.", "label": 1, "id": 100282}

{"text": "One important aspect of the protostellar mass growth process is the accretion rate of material onto the forming star. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate this rate, such as the efficiency of mass transfer from the surrounding gas reservoir, is crucial for modeling the overall process of star formation. In addition, the duration of mass growth can be strongly influenced by the properties of the protostellar disk that forms around the star. These disks can provide a long-term reservoir of material that can fuel continued accretion; however, they can also undergo fragmentation and other disruptive processes that limit the duration of mass growth. Finally, the variability of mass growth - both in terms of the rate and the amount of material accreted - can be driven by a variety of factors, including turbulent motions in the surrounding gas, feedback from protostellar outflows, and interactions with other nearby stars or protostellar systems. Overall, understanding these processes is critical for developing a comprehensive theory of star formation that can account for the full range of observed stellar populations and their properties.", "label": 1, "id": 100284}

Recent studies have shown that the luminosity function of galaxies in filaments may differ from that of galaxies outside of filaments. It is possible that the increased density and gravitational forces in filaments may create an environment that affects the formation and evolution of satellite galaxies differently than in other regions of the universe.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed a sample of primary galaxies with identified satellite galaxies within a distance of 1 Mpc from the primary galaxy. We then separated the primary galaxies into two groups based on their location in filaments or outside of filaments. We found that the satellite luminosity function of galaxies in filaments was different than the luminosity function of galaxies outside of filaments. Specifically, we found that the number of bright satellite galaxies was higher in filaments, while the number of low-luminosity satellites was higher in regions outside of filaments.\n\nThese results suggest that the environment plays a role in the formation and evolution of satellite galaxies.

The special effects were surprisingly good for a made-for-TV movie, and the storyline was keeping me on the edge of my seat.\n\nThe movie was about a group of scientists who had discovered a parallel universe. They were able to create a portal to this universe, and they sent a team of researchers through to explore it. When the team returned, however, they were different. They had been exposed to some sort of energy in the parallel universe that had altered them both physically and mentally.\n\nThe rest of the movie focused on the team's struggle to cope with these changes and understand the nature of the parallel universe. As the story unfolded, it became clear that this other universe was not a peaceful place. There were dangerous creatures and hostile forces that threatened not only the team but also their entire world.\n\nAs the movie reached its climax, I found myself rooting for the team and hoping that they would find a way to save themselves and their world. The ending was satisfying, but it left me with so many more questions about what happens in this parallel universe and the implications it could have.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. It was a well-made, entertaining, and thought-provoking story that kept me engaged from beginning to end. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi and adventure movies.", "label": 1, "id": 100318}

{"text": "Their research revealed that credit market imperfections often lead to a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals, who then have a disproportionate control over the allocation of resources. This leads to a situation where those who are most deserving of resources, such as the poor and talented individuals, are denied access to crucial investment opportunities. As a result, inequalities between different socioeconomic groups become entrenched and continue to persist over time.\n\nMoreover, the research demonstrated that credit market imperfections can also negatively impact the quality of education and human capital formation. This is because individuals from poorer backgrounds are unable to finance their education, while the rich are able to afford the best education and training opportunities. Consequently, the rich have more opportunities to acquire and develop skills, which makes them more productive and successful in the labor market.\n\nThis has significant implications for economic growth and development, as a workforce that is not optimally skilled and educated will struggle to compete in a globalized economy. The research by Galor and Zeira highlights the need for policies and interventions that address credit market imperfections and promote access to education and training opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Only then can inequality be reduced and economic growth and development be sustained in the long run.", "label": 1, "id": 100320}

{"text": "This approach has been found to be highly effective in accurately describing the dynamics of electron and positron scattering, which is essential for understanding a variety of physical phenomena such as astrophysical radiation and particle physics. The solution of the two-center Dirac equation involves the calculation of the wave function, which is a complex function of the spatial and temporal coordinates of the system. By adopting a non-perturbative approach, the wave function can be calculated exactly without resorting to approximations, which allows for a more accurate description of the system. In order to properly describe the potential of the nuclei, a variety of techniques such as semiclassical methods, numerical integration, and configuration interaction have been employed. Additionally, the solution of the two-center Dirac equation for heavy nuclei requires the use of high-performance computing resources, which have become increasingly powerful in recent years.

The @xmath1 parameter controls the relative importance of these two objectives.\n\nSeveral examples of infinite horizon optimal control problems are discussed in the literature, including the classical LQR problem and the linear-quadratic regulator problem. These problems have been extensively studied and many efficient numerical methods have been developed to solve them.\n\nOther examples include the optimal control of a heat equation, where the objective is to minimize the energy required to maintain a desired temperature, and the control of a population model, where the objective is to maximize the population size while minimizing the cost of harvesting.\n\nIn all of these problems, the goal is to design a control law that achieves the desired objective while minimizing a certain cost function.

{"text": "the distance between any two points, the angles formed by three or more points, or the convex hull enclosing the point set. This makes it possible to study the properties of point sets using geometry and topology. One area of research that has emerged in recent years is the study of random point sets and their geometric properties. By sampling points from a distribution, one can study the average behavior of point sets, and test conjectures and hypotheses about their properties.\n\nIn particular, researchers have studied random point sets in the plane with different distributions, such as uniform distributions, Poisson distributions, or Gaussian distributions. These point sets exhibit different geometric properties, such as clustering, uniformity, or rigidity. Understanding the statistical and topological properties of these point sets is not only of theoretical interest, but also has applications in various fields, such as computer vision, machine learning, or data analysis.\n\nOne of the challenges in studying random point sets is to develop tools and techniques for analyzing them. This often requires a combination of mathematical and computational methods, such as geometry, topology, probability theory, or Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, understanding the behavior of specific families of distributions, such as the Voronoi tessellations or Delaunay triangulations associated with point sets, requires developing specialized techniques and algorithms.\n\nDespite the challenges, the study of random point sets has led to many interesting results and insights in geometry and topology. For example, it has been shown that the Delaunay triangulation of a random point set becomes increasingly similar to the convex hull of the point set as the number of points grows large. Additionally, it has been shown that certain properties of the Delaunay triangulation, such as its connectivity or diameter, exhibit phase transitions at certain critical thresholds.\n\nOverall, the study of random point sets provides a rich source of mathematical problems, with applications in various fields. As our ability to generate and analyze large datasets grows, understanding the statistical and geometric properties of point sets will become increasingly important.", "label": 1, "id": 100353}

When an immune cell encounters an antigen that matches its receptor, it undergoes clonal expansion, a process of proliferation that creates many copies of itself to mount a targeted immune response. Burnet's theory helped to explain how the immune system can respond to an almost infinite number of different antigens while also avoiding attacking the body's own cells. The concept of clonal selection theory has since been elaborated upon and refined, and it remains a cornerstone of modern immunology. It has led to the development of vaccines and immunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to fight infections and diseases such as cancer.", "label": 1, "id": 100356}

This shortage pushed up prices for goods linked to oil-based transport such as food, clothing, and almost all daily consumer goods. The US economy fell into a recession as a result of the high cost of oil and the resultant high inflation rate. Inflation in the United States was hitting an all-time high, reaching 13.3 percent in 1979, followed by a more modest 10.3 percent in 1981. It was clear that something had to be done to address the country's dependence on foreign oil. \n\nIn response, the Carter administration instituted several methods to reduce oil consumption and decrease the US dependence on foreign oil. The creation of the Department of Energy, the imposition of fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, and the increase in the use of natural gas were among the Carter administration's initiatives. Due to these efforts, the United States saw a considerable reduction in oil imports, which fell from more than 40% of consumption in 1977 to about 28% in 1985.

{"text": "The Roman and Celtic coins, which date from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD and are found in large numbers in the Roman city, show that coins and circulation played a key role in the establishment and development of cities in this region. The coins represent a wide variety of mints, and many issues are closely related in terms of their design and composition, thus showing the importance of money as an element of urban planning and the formation of a local economic and trading network. The coins are very beautiful and their design also exhibits great artistic expression, with the most characteristic feature of the coins being that of the image of the city and its gods. All of this is linked very closely to the establishment of the Roman influence, which in turn was a decisive factor in the development of cities in the Roman province of Britannia from the 1st until the 3rd century AD.\n\n(In the picture to the right: 1st-3rd century Roman/Celtic coins found in London, at the British Museum. 1st century AD, 2nd century AD. 3rd century AD.)\n\nRoman coins\n\nThe Roman Empire was a highly urbanised system. In contrast to the more traditionally agriculturally oriented cities of previous periods, it adopted city planning and developed a great degree of infrastructure and developed urbanisation across the Empire and beyond. The Romans were interested in making the most of their city centres, such as Rome itself or the imperial cities such as Alexandria (Egypt), Carthage (Tunisia), Constantinople (Constantinople), Ephesus, Pergamum, or Nicomedia (near Izmir). The city was always the centre of an economic, cultural and political system. The Roman imperial cities are a large collection of urban agglomerations, the urban agglomerations were often surrounded by walls, fortifications or both.\n\nThe City of London is the capital city of London and the largest in the country, with a population of 875,000 (2000) within the greater London boundary.\n\nIn 1871, the Office of Works was set up to manage the public space. It established the main roads, parks, bridges and fountains. They also had the responsibility of maintaining all the sewers, water pipes and other infrastructure of the city. Today, the Office of Works is the London Corporation, charged with a number of roles such as the maintenance of London\u2019s roads and other public realm.\n\nDuring the course of the second millennium, London was in a position to grow without restraint, and as a result, it developed into the global city of the late twentieth century. This boom and the building boom that followed, the creation of new offices and offices that required new housing, the expansion of the transport sector, and urban planning which resulted in the creation of a large amount of new construction, together with the constant growth throughout the last millennium made the growth in Greater London unstoppable over the century (Figure 1).\n\nThe boom began during the 1980s and continues throughout the 1990s; it is expected that the metropolitan area of London will remain a key position in Europe, as an international finance centre and one of the most important business-related hubs.\n\nThe urban space\n\nThe expansion of London, as an international financial centre, led to an expansion of the population from 1,300,000 (in 1800) to more than six million in 2016, and it has been the biggest city in the world since the beginning of the century. The population in Greater London grew over eightfold in two hundred years, and London\u2019s population had a yearly growth rate between 1500 and 1700 of 2.8% (Cannadine).\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the London\u2019s urban area covered 1,430 square kilometres. Since then, this urban space has continued to increase at a rate of around 6 kilometres every year.\n\nThe growth in Greater London is therefore the main reason for the expansion of the city, which is reflected in the increase in the population and the expansion in the outer area. At the beginning of the twenty first century, the \u2018outer perimeters\u2019 of London consisted of 1,500 square kilometres, which is almost four times the area covered by London in 1850, showing an average population growth ranging between 20 and 36%, and a peak growth rate of 47% (Wrigley and Schofield).\n\nThis growth of the city\u2019s outer boundaries in the form of urban sprawl is a phenomenon common throughout the British Isles. Over the last century, the rapid expansion of cities, at first in the north and later south and east has led to a large and continuous transformation of the spatial configuration of British cities and towns, resulting in a vast and heterogeneous complex of villages, rural and urban areas, expanding over increasingly wider distance than the former villages and cities or the historic city centre (Figure 2).\n\nThe study carried out between 1868 and 2012 \u2013 \u2018Greater London and the", "label": 1, "id": 100401}

{"text": "rotocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is a great actor in her prime at the height of her powers: Halle Berry, who is every bit as cool as James Bond. However, Halle Berry is the only thing about this movie that makes sense.\n\nIt might not sound so bad when one reads the script: Halle Berry's character, Lola, is a drug pusher, and James Bond just wants to meet her in Cuba (which he doesn't find) so he can get the information without being kidnapped (which he also does find out in some other way) which will eventually lead him to a plan to capture the villains and eventually the villains' home base. This is all explained fairly accurately as long as you understand how Halle Berry's character gets her drugs.\n\nOne would think that the movie was going to be about Lola as a drug pusher, but she also has a sister who is working for the FBI. A couple of agents are working undercover to look for her, so they have the run-around until they finally find Lola's sister. When they do, they reveal that Lola's job is to sell the information she gets from the terrorists (they are planning to blow up American ships or planes) to the highest bidders, so that the highest bidder can then blow up the ships and planes.\n\nThe trouble is, these terrorists are very clever, and the agent who is assigned to tail her knows Lola is a drug dealer, so she calls out her cover. Lola, who is only there to help her sister, thinks she is getting out of something easy, and is actually willing to sell information about the planned attacks on American aircraft carriers. This is about as crazy as it sounds, as they have agents flying in on C130's with hundreds of pounds of explosives to destroy one of the largest, most heavily armed American vessels in the history of the United States, and Lola says, \"Oh dear, it really does sound stupid and dangerous. How about I just call it off and you tell 'em you didn't hear nothing?\"\n\nAfter spending some time at her sister's place, Lola decides to head off alone to a rendezvous she can set up there with a buyer she is certain will go home and try to find out if the deal actually went through, or if the plan was scrapped because the agent tipped off the FBI. Her plan involves a small Cessna plane, and a very heavy cocaine load.\n\nIf you can read the dialogue and put yourself in the mind of the characters, it is possible to figure out what is going on. The trouble is, the screenplay tries to do more than the story it has. The trouble is, the story is as follows:\n\n\u2022 First, there is the small aircraft with two tons of blow. It had to be a small aircraft. It could be a Cessna, but they don't fly Cessna 182-T Skyraiders around Cuba all day long.\n\n\u2022 One other thing--what's to stop them from just calling the FBI or the air force and saying, \"Hey, we have your woman and if you want to come get her, we'll tell her the bombs are off and we won't blow the boats up\"? The only thing that works against that is the fact that she would have to bring them both out alive, and only the second agent had the chance to blow up the plane with the bombs. Then when he sees his partner, he just goes home. If it were actually that easy, we could watch Lola get caught, fly home with a little money that she really doesn't have a lot of in America, and then start all over again. She is the only real character in this movie, which is pretty much about Agent James Bond and his friend Agent Wint. No one else has any reason other than to get back where she came from.\n\n\u2022 Finally, it wouldn't be Lola. It would be the agent, whom Bond, as he has to since it didn't occur to the scriptwriter that anyone else could come up with the idea to blow up an airplane with tons of explosives. He doesn't work as a double agent at her sister's place; he is just there in case they were actually successful.\n\n\u2022 There may be another purpose. The movie ends with Bond having a \"nice trip\" (which is how it actually is), and he gets Lola safely out of Cuba before her sister dies. The last thing it's said is that Lola works for the FBI and that Bond and his friend were good at getting things, too, \"The best I've ever seen.\" No reason to be surprised at that--Bond is a British agent.\n\nI was never able to figure out why the CIA sent in a \"girl\" with explosives on a Cessna plane. I think the idea was to prove to her that the CIA was serious about getting her out", "label": 1, "id": 100403}
{"text": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have different names for different goods. In economics this is called the classification problem: the problem of identifying which rule applies to a particular good.  (A good being something that one wants to make money on, if you're familiar with economics it may be more accurately paraphrased by saying the classification problem is the problem of identifying which class of goods one wants to sell.)\nI think the rules that govern classified items in a store aren't really rules at all but merely descriptions of the items. A store sells these items based on descriptive features (the brand and the price range), and the way they are classified here is really just a matter of convenience - if you have a store which sells the items listed above, there's really no way to determine if it follows any specific rules. If, for example, you wanted a store to sell a box of chocolates but it only had three types - you could look in the store at the classification descriptions, and you might think of buying a chocolate at all three places, but it would be a strange situation where it didn't know whether all the chocolates were considered the same or whether they were all considered different.\nOf course, there is in fact a common classification scheme in use for these items - it's known as primary colour, which is typically a classification into red or green or blue. I suppose you could also talk about \"natural\" red and \"natural\" green and \"natural\" blue, which might be a sub-classification for any of the three basic colours - i.e. the \"natural\" colour that's closest to either of the basic colours in the sense that you can go from one to the other by changing that particular colour, and then go further to the extremes - red may have a sub-classification of \"bright\" red and \"really quite dark\" red, and the same for green and blue.\nBut even this scheme is pretty informal: in fact, even in primary colour you can't say that the primary colour refers to a particular basic colour, but rather it refers to the one with the most \"energy\" (I'll try to get a better explanation for this concept that I just made up, if no one else has any good way to do it). Similarly, if chocolate was a primary colour, it could have no sub-classifications at all; if it were, it would simply be \"food\" - the food in a box of chocolates, and not necessarily the colour of chocolate that it is (a sub-classification in the case of food) or its contents (a sub-sub-classification).\n\nA:\n\nYou're not describing a recipe, but a taxonomy, there's a difference, you may also find it in taxonomies, like the USDA or the FDA:\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/AOAC_FS_0050.pdf\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTR/CFTR.cfm?CDRID=1618.\nThere it's common to put the different items in a box, with a set of rules determining where you must sell it (in the sense of a taxonomic relationship between the items and the rules).\n\n", "label": 1, "id": 100404}

{"text": "First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2/5s stars is because it was made by a man trying really, really hard to be a woman on screen. Yes, this film has some good points, but it feels too long and there are several other things that should have been done better.\n\nBut before I begin, I'd like to point out that I think this film's director, James Kent (born a man) was trying too hard to \"be\" a woman, and some of his decisions aren't even close to being a female (except that he has breasts on-screen of course) - he's almost as far from being a woman as he would be from being a man.\n\nSo let's begin with the positives first.\n\n1.) There are some positives.\n\nThe first positive is that there are some points where it seems like the filmmakers are making a film about women and their problems and this is a step in the right direction. For example, in the beginning the main character has an abortion which makes her feel a lot of guilt, pain, and regret. Her husband says that she had better things to do than getting pregnant with him (that's the line when the character explains to her husband that she had an abortion).\n\nBut then in later parts of the film, the main character tells the viewers that abortion is a bad idea, and that you're better making a child with your husband and raising it in the best interest of that child.\n\nBut the problem is that she contradicts herself twice and it seems like she's trying too hard to come across as a woman on a mission to make a film and she's only telling the audience what they want to hear.\n\nAnother example about the character being too much of a man instead of a woman is when the main character is in a parking garage where she tells her friend that she and her husband will raise their kids in this garage because it'll be cheaper than having a car and her friend is like:\n\nBut this friend is supposed to be a woman because she has boobs (those, and of course she has them on-screen. The character is also shown as having long, blonde hair. I'm almost positive that this woman has never been on this planet in a million years, because her appearance and dialogue have made her a man).\n\nOne more example is on the character's husband - he tells her that he wants a baby so they can raise their kids together, and she's worried about him leaving her because she's a woman (she's always trying to make herself better than her husband, which is odd because she keeps referring to him as \"my husband\").\n\n2.) There are some points of feminism.\n\nThere are times where the directors of this film are trying to show the idea of women being equal to men - they point out how much more \"manly\" men are than women are.\n\nThis point was made in how some women have menial jobs and men are usually more \"manly\" and have more power in a workplace, which makes them \"better.\"\n\nThey also point out how women are usually on a mission to have a baby because they're told that having a baby would make them better as individuals.\n\nBut their feminism also points out how women are always trying to make themselves better than they were previously. Because they always feel like they're not good enough, they also try to make themselves \"better\" through getting plastic surgery, getting cosmetic procedures like having \"a real breasts,\" waxed eyebrows, using lotion, and looking perfect in order to appear better to other men and get more attention. They'll also dress or act sexy in order to be more attractive to men.\n\nThey also get plastic surgery, not because they want to have a baby, but because they want to look better in front of men, women, and everyone else.\n\nThe film also states that men will always prefer women who are more manly or look better in an effort to get women to conform to what they want.\n\nIt's very obvious that this film made by a man was made in an effort to help a lot of women, but the film ends up making it seem like one large joke. The film starts out with the main character having an abortion (something that she regrets later in the film), the main character has her face fully (or near-fully) covered up, and it looks like she has on a head scarf. And there's something underneath the head scarf but I haven't seen any clips from the film.\n\nHer outfit consists of wearing a skirt that's extremely transparent and also reveals her butt - a lot! The character also has long, blonde hair. Then they start talking about women being sexy in an effort to show that the film was made with a feminist theme, but then it goes downhill quickly.\n\n3.) \"I Wasn't Real But Now I'm The Real", "label": 1, "id": 100407}

According to Star Wars legend, the city was built by the Jedi under the direction of an unknown \"Old Jedi\". At least that's what the Star Wars games and RPG's tell you. The truth is slightly different. The city, and the people who live in it, are, well they're pretty good at making money. They were first to get the jump on New Alderaan before the Empire, or the First Order, invaded it.\n\nThe first generation of New Alderaanian citizens were refugees from the New Alderaan system. The New Alderaanians were known to be people who came from the old New Alderaan system. They were refugees who were escaping the planet and they ended up starting their lives off in a foreign city. They settled there first, but as they became more prosperous, they gradually returned to their homeland, to the original city of New Alderaan. New Alderaan still remained a small city at that time, as the Jedi had just begun using New Alderaan for shelter. New Alderaanians quickly adopted the Galactic Nuts and Zaxes (the original species made famous by the Old Republic era), and built out the city and its technology. Within New Alderaan, the New Alderaanians took control of the government, the military, banking, finance, law enforcement, and most other industries. The New Alderaanians eventually took control of all the planets in the New Alderaan star system.\n\nThe New Alderaanians were a people who valued their culture and traditions and they were proud of them. Although it was their original planet, they refused to forget their roots and they kept many aspects of the traditions and culture of their home planet. They were a people who believed that there was no place for the old ways in the New Alderaan system. For most New Alderaanians, New Alderaan was their home world, but there were a few who still dreamt of their original home, even though it was thousands of light years away. The Nuts and Zaxes have been a symbol of hope for a long time. People dreamt of living with their kind again on their home planet. They always maintained a connection with their \"home planet\", even though they all lived out of state. They called it home only at the night time.\n\nHowever, these New Alderaanians also had a high regard for the culture of the New Republic. The Nuts and Zaxes were a strong symbol for the New Republic, as well as for New Alderaan. People on different planets had different experiences and ideas that influenced them to form a unique, rich, diverse and individualized society. New Alderaanians were proud of their history, and they had pride in their culture as well. They were still New Alderaanians after all. They continued to build their society. They still maintained their traditions and their culture. Many New Alderaanians still believed that it was the \"home planet\". It was the planet where they were born. It was the planet they loved.\n\nAfter the Yuuzhan Vong War, New Alderaanians started to see themselves as a part of a larger galactic community- as a \"Galactic Citizen\" as much as any other Star Wars character. They still loved their traditions and culture, but they had come to believe that their homeland was gone. It had been taken away from them. But they still remembered and cherished their home. They kept their roots in the home planet as a symbol and a reminder to themselves of what they once knew, what they once loved, and to not forget their own roots. They kept their heritage, their traditions, their language, their culture, and their society intact. They just kept their traditions, but they were no longer content with them being the only symbol of their culture and their heritage. They began to embrace more than one symbol of their heritage and culture. They embraced it all. They wanted their descendants too remember the past. The New Alderaanians kept New Alderaanian values alive through the ages and their culture survived. They gave their descendants all the knowledge and knowhow of their origins. They tried hard to teach them, just like they were taught as children. They lived on their past, their heritage. But they wanted them to remember where they came from as well. They helped them to remember their home, to remember their past, and to remember their roots. The New Alderaanians always looked back and they lived in the memories of their true past, the past of their home planet New Alderaan.\n\nSo, the New Alderaanians set out on their mission to return home.

{"text": "we discuss the nonlinear current of an interacting quantum dot coupled to a superconductor as well as to a ferromagnetic lead. As a main result we obtain a fully analytic expression for this current as expressed in Eq.\u00a0, which can be evaluated in a very rapid approximation using the recursive Green\u2019s function algebra. The analytical result for the current simplifies to the familiar BCS current if the Kitaev coupling $J$ vanishes. In contrast to the superconducting case, the current is nonzero even in the weak coupling limit since the coupling between the dot and the ferromagnetic lead is not taken into account. Moreover, the current is also non-monotonic in the coupling between the dot and the superconducting lead and is always finite. Hence, superconducting ferromagnetic leads also offer a natural realization of the Majorana fermion physics.\n\nWe start to discuss the dot-superconductor junction in Section\u00a0\\[sec:SCdotSC\\]. There we give the Hamiltonian of the system and discuss the particle hole symmetric case.

He visited Greece on 6 July 1995 and returned on 11 July 1995. He presented on 7 August 1995 with a maculopapular rash over his trunk and arms which began on 13 August 1995. He experienced non-pruritic burning mite skin reactions over all parts of his trunk at various times.\n\nOn 17 August 1995 a rash over his scalp with a raised crust over the scalp, resembling chickenpox, was present. He developed similar lesions on the palms of his hands and feet on 18 August 1995; he claimed to believe this was due to a mosquito bite.\n\nThe patient was seen in the Dermatology Department at Great Ormond Street Hospital on 22 August 1995 and a skin biopsy was taken. Specimens of warts from the patient's mouth and arm were sent for histological examination and the patient was commenced on doxycycline to treat possible systemic infection. The histology of the arm wart showed similar morphological appearances as described by Brinker and Jones [1]. The specimen showed warts with well defined keratinocytes which had undergone keratinization and appeared squamous in arrangement. However, a skin surface biopsy was also sampled and the result of the histology of this lesion showed a wart with more typical morphological features of keratoacanthoma (Fig. 1). The clinical features and histological features correlated well with those of Brinker and Jones [1] and we concluded that the head and scalp and arm warts were typical verrucae vulvae. However, although a well defined raised erythema and keratotic crust with surrounding lymphadenopathy are characteristic features of varicella-zoster virus infection, a more definitive diagnosis could not be made. The patient was subsequently referred to the Haematology department for further management and the patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 5 days.\n\nFig. 1\n\nSkin biopsy: The specimen shows warts with well defined keratinocytes which had undergone keratinization and appeared squamous in arrangement.

Should lesions be sampled from warts which are only at a localised stage? If the histology showed only well defined warts, does that mean that they are actually viral warts and will clear with adequate treatment?

They also talk about the time they dressed up in drag as the Andrews Sisters for an afternoon on the NBC Burbank lot.\n\nWhat made you decide it was time to do a new show on TV again?\n\nDICK MARTIN: We've done the Tonight Show so much we thought, \"Let's try something new.\" My first show was back in 1953 and Dick was the assistant producer. What amazes me about it is that the three of us are still here--as are most of the people who were there on the first show.\n\nYour show's success was due, in part, to being a show that wasn't afraid of being a show. Even though you were only on at 7:30, you stayed light and you had some people who were willing to do comedy. What would be like to have a show now that was a comedy?\n\nROWAN: On my first show we were almost all people who had been on Amos & Andy, because we didn't know any other funny people. Today you don't have to be afraid to be funny... and now there are comedy clubs all over the world.\n\nHow would what the audience expects be different on your new show?\n\nMARTIN: A show that isn't afraid to be a comedy. It's more serious than we're used to, but we want to give them something that's a little lighter.\n\nHave you always been more of the story-teller, or has that role fallen to you?\n\nMARTIN: Dick used to be the story-teller. He still is.\n\nROWAN: We are always telling stories.\n\nMARTIN: Today, we're telling stories. Before, we used to have the people tell the stories, the way you see on the movies.\n\nHow about stories you will tell?\n\nMARTIN: We'll probably tell stories of the people who show up on our show. We'll probably do more interviews, like we did the first time.\n\nDan, one of the people who appeared on Laugh-In was David Wayne. He was an actor, a singer and even wrote a few songs. How much did you write for your own show?\n\nROWAN: Dave didn't write any songs, Dick. We had three writers who wrote, sang, and acted.\n\nWhere are some of your favorite songs that were written for the show?\n\nMARTIN: We had a song written by David, a couple by Fred Freeman, and one by Danny Kaye.\n\nDan, what was your favorite thing about the show?\n\nROWAN: When it started, we had two characters who were kind of a little offbeat... Charlie and Dick. They would say \"We like you--because you like us!\"\n\nMARTIN: We wanted them to be two very funny guys, and they were both very funny; we didn't make them too serious. We wanted them to laugh at each other.\n\nDick, you had been a producer on the show before.\n\nMARTIN: I loved it so much that when the two of us got tired of running the show after almost 20 years, I just walked away from it.

{"text": "I am a big fan of old horror movies, and I've already watched several of J.H. Warner's many classic Universal Studios films over the weekend. I was recently in a discussion with some fellow horror fanatics about the great horror host Vincent Price, and it would be very cool to share a couple of Vincent's horror movie stories about the amazing creature effects that were used in the golden era of movie monsters.\n\nVincent was a horror host in a variety of ways, from his legendary appearances on the old anthology series \"The Chiller Theatre\" hosted by Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, to co-hosting the first \"Creature Features\" show on the nascent local television network called WFIL Channel 6 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Vincent was the first host of the weekly science fiction anthology TV series, The Ray Bradbury Theater (1966-1967), and his last horror movie hosting gig was for the cult series \"The Monkees\", the TV sequel of sorts to the Monkees rock band that ran from 1966 to 1968. Vincent was, in addition to all these, a successful and prolific writer and director of horror films, and he was incredibly smart, witty, and quick of wit. If anyone of you out there needs any advice on how to succeed in the life of a horror host, this guy is an excellent example to follow.\n\nVincent was particularly fond of monster movies, and in this two-part interview, he shares some of his favorite stories about the creature effects used in the horror movies that he starred in and hosted.\n\nThe story of Vincent on \"Mister Sinister\" has been told many times before, because he co-starred in the classic horror film with Boris Karloff produced by Universal Studios in 1942. In Vincent's words, \"This is the film with the green skin, and the big mouth! I had a great time making this film. We spent a month on location in Los Angeles. It was an amazing movie. We made a lot of money on this one. I was lucky that this was happening when I was making my own feature starring Boris Karloff, although the director was Joe May!\"\n\nThe famous image, courtesy of the \"Mister Sinister\" poster above, shows Boris Karloff's character standing on the rooftop across the street from what looks like an old factory, with Vincent standing right next to him waving both of his arms. It is, of course, the iconic scene in the movie where Boris Karloff's character, \"Mister Sinister\", reveals his face for the first time with the creature's visage appearing on Karloff's right eye. After giving the evil creature all the evil details, the camera pans to the building behind them, and the next few shots take place inside the factory as the actor in the lead role is revealed to actually be Vincent Price as he fights off the monster as well as Mr. Karloff himself. It is the only Universal Studios horror movie that I've seen with live animal actor's footage as opposed to animatronic, doll, or muppet creations.\n\nI wonder about the use of live actors in the film, though? The shot of Karloff's character on the rooftop looks very awkward, as if someone were taking a photo of a subject who was not quite looking at the camera. Karloff looks like he is looking down upon Vincent as the monster's face materializes across his eye, while Vincent is being somewhat annoyed, as it were, by the other actor. I really like the way the sequence turns out, and the way the whole thing plays into the theme of the movie which is all about the evil power of the human eye. I'd like to believe that it would have been better to film the scene as animated, but that would also change the tone of the whole thing, and it wouldn't have the same kind of authenticity of using the actors in the sequence as it did.\n\nWhile the monster's face is being projected onto Karloff's eye, one might expect the actor will be able to blink or at least close his eyes to block out the projected visage, but Karloff is perfectly still. The image of his face fades into the monster's visage, while Vincent is still being annoyed. It's very well done, and it's not unlike watching the actual scene unfold, as if a real person is the one looking through the eye of the camera, and another character is getting photographed.\n\nVincent Price was born John Vincent Mulvihill on April 26th, 1917, in Easton, Pennsylvania, a small suburb of Philadelphia, and he was the son of Dr. Henry John Mulvihill and his wife Nell McElroy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Vincent earned a degree in English and French from La Salle University and later attended Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, where he studied electrical engineering and met his wife, Joan, who was of Russian and Polish descent.

The Turing Machines are an important branch of computing as Turing's model of computation is considered to be the most popular and successful model ever to study computation. His aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles. It is to be noted that computability and decidability are separate properties for a problem. A problem can be computable without any of its outcomes being decided, nor can it be decided without its outcomes being computable.\n\nMany computable problems have been discovered. Some of these functions are recursive, others are not. Examples of these functions include Factorial, Ackermann's function, the halting problem, the Halting Problem, the Church-Turing thesis, the Universal Turing Machine, the Turing Machine, the \u03bb-calculus, the Turing Machine with one tape, and many others.\n\nThe history of computational complexity can be traced back to Turing's work on the halting problem, published in 1936. He introduced the concept of a Turing machine that he then used to establish the existence of the halting problem and its unsolvability.\n\nThe main research in computability theory has been centered at the Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton, in New Jersey, and at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Recently, the theory has been adopted by a large number of mathematicians and computer scientists within the United States.\n\n\u201cTuring machines are an important branch of computing as Turing's model of computation is considered to be the most popular and successful model ever to study computation. His aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuring's aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles. However there are issues about the foundation of this theory. It has been questioned on two counts. The first is that he was too general with the axioms for the Turing machine. The second is that the proof he gave has not turned up a computational strategy or strategy proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile they are similar in conception to the Turing machine, one is a model of computation while the other is a model of computation in the category of sets of natural numbers. This leads to quite divergent philosophies on both theory and computational practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be that this view will be taken up. I also think it would be very useful to see the theory of computation in terms of the computable functions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between decidability and computability is fundamental to computational theory. Decidability is a property of a problem while computability is a property of the solution to said problem. A solution can be computable without being decidable, and vice versa.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, the halting problem is decidable, but a solution to the halting problem cannot always be proved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe halting problem is one of the main sources of problems in a computability theore. These are problems that have no solution, i.e., there exist no program that accepts all inputs and halts with a yes-answer decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the main differences between computability and decidability is a key distinction between theorems and their proofs. A mathematical theorem is the proof of a hypothesis, this theorem establishes that this hypothesis is true. A proof is an argument that shows that a theorem, such as the Pigeonhole Principle for instance, is true. To prove that a theorem is true, the mathematician's proof, which would be the proof of contradiction, would be required to show that the statement's antecedent is false. The antecedent is the assumption preceding the theorem and would have to be false. Therefore the proof of a proof of a theorem is invalid and cannot be considered a valid mathematical argument. However a proof need not be valid. For example, the proof by contradiction, commonly known as the \u201cproof by negation\u201d, was not actually a valid mathematical argument. It is possible the negation of a claim in itself is false, thus negating the truth of said claim is also false, despite being a valid argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike the Turing machine, G\u00f6del's incom", "label": 1, "id": 100417}
{"text": "This movie was way over-hyped. A lot of the viewers, I feel, felt they were being forced to watch it, and that didn't sit well with me. The whole setup was really poorly done as well, but that's another story.The problem with the movie was that it was really hard to keep up with everything going on in the story line. The story was all over the place, confusing the audiences and making them feel dizzy because they were trying to figure everything out as well. The plot was interesting I suppose, and it added a lot of mystery but it could've been much better. Most of the special effects were pretty good, there were some that were good, like the one that showed the guy in the tank that was fighting (who I don't remember who he was), but most of the special effects were overdone and really unrealistic.I'm not going to go into what the whole story was all about, it would be pointless, since some people might still want to see this and I really doubt anyone would really understand it without the context of the story. But I want to comment on what I think about the movie as well, so that you can understand me a bit better.The whole premise, as I said before, was a bit confusing and there was way too much going on. To me, I felt like the movie should've gone the way they originally planned it. There were a few scenes, with some of the characters, that were well done for the most part and those were kind of the best scenes. What made it hard to keep up with everything was that there were three plots going on at the same time, and that was all very disjointed and confusing. I'm not very good at keeping up with the plots sometimes, especially when things are split up into three plots, but that's only my own opinion. One of the big problems was that it was not well made. You had to figure a ton of stuff out, and it wasn't fun. Most people know movies where they have to guess their way around and try to figure things out. That's basically what the movie did, so that was kinda the problem. I found it very hard to keep track of everything, since it was split of into three entirely different stories, and most of what they were doing didn't make sense at all.The big problem that I didn't like, was that it was so confusing, most of the audience couldn't follow it, they couldn't understand why some things were happening at a given time. It was hard to think about the movie because when things were all over the place and at different parts of the movie, and most of the characters were being introduced into the movie after the movie really started. It made me really angry sometimes, trying to keep up with the movie because I couldn't follow it, and that pissed me off. It didn't make sense. The movie was a little childish and I didn't like that.What made this movie a little childish, was that everything had a little bit of humor. It started off with little jokes and things like that, but slowly the jokes turned into too much and they became kind of cringy. I was kind of turned off by some of the humor and it was forced into me. The biggest example of this humor, was the whole thing with the girl who was playing at being the girl, the guy with the girl hat. It was so forced and weird that I wasn't into it at all. The way they made her look and act was pretty over the top and weird. He really had to try, just to convince people that it was a mask, but that wasn't funny at all. I found it uncomfortable just laughing. I thought at first that the mask would crack once the guy was done with it and let him take it off, but the movie was kind of weird and it never really happened. Overall I would give it a 6/10. It could've been more clear and understandable but some parts were still really good and really great. Just about everyone should go see it, you just have to watch your brain, that's all.I'm now going to tell you how I would rate the special effects of the movie. I'll go in order from worst to first best. Here they go:A. Tank at the beginningB. Tank near the end. It would have been great!C. Girl in a tank holding a knifeD. Movie credits. That didn't last long.E. Water under someone. Maybe not the worst, but definitely not the best.F. Kid in a room that was moving. Weird. G. Girl in a white room. Ummm..... Weird?H. Kid in a room with a little boy. Weird. I would have preferred to see her in a room with a boy who was the same age. I think it would have been better.If I had to rate this from a point from zero to a hundred, I would have said I would rate it a", "label": 1, "id": 100418}
{"text": "Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before its discovery. We learn that in the late 17th century, a Scottish physician named John Rowley noticed that humans could not breathe or exercise efficiently without fresh oxygen.\n\nThe doctor first attempted to persuade people of this fact by showing them the effects of inhaling gas with and without oxygen. He wanted to prove the fact that the human system needs oxygen to work properly. By doing this, Rowley discovered something that had probably been known or suspected for several centuries: that there is an oxygen-rich atmosphere in which mammals can live. But it was not until the next century that scientists isolated pure, crystalline oxygen gas and found that animals can't live without it.\n\nBy then, scientists knew that atmospheric air was usually only a trace component of our atmosphere. The rest of it exists in a mixture of the following gases: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, inert gases such as argon and neon, and trace amounts of other gases. In the past few years, the use of air-filtering devices has helped to make breathing cleaner for people. But not all air pollution is due to dirty factories, automobile exhaust, or poor sanitation. We inhale air that has been processed, filtered, and reconditioned to remove many dangerous impurities. We even breathe it directly as an aid to rest from strenuous exercise. (If you've ever stayed in a hotel, a private hospital, a spa, a beauty parlor, or a similar place, you will have seen the constant hum of machines to recondition the air that is circulated through those very rooms. The same process can be used to purify air anywhere.)\n\nScientists have discovered that some of those harmful substances do much more than just make us ill when we breathe them. Some poisons have very serious effects even if the body is exposed to them for only short periods of time\u2014too short to cause permanent harm. But a few poisons have other health effects that are important to monitor or to avoid. When we are exposed to a poisonous substance, we may develop headaches or have a weak or shaking hand, but not all exposure to poisons produces serious consequences.\n\n**_The toxic substances in human air are as great an impediment to health as water and other common substances of life are to health._**\n\n**RANDOLPH D. MARSHALL**\n\n_\"We must realize that modern air pollution is a threat to the health not only of the millions who breathe polluted air in cities, but also of the many who, for the sake of clean living, must limit their outdoor activities to brief periods.\"_\n\n**J.

This lack of a reaction to the toxin is because no mechanism to detect or block this toxin has evolved in the body. However, if a toxic substance is inhaled into the body, a specific system designed to protect the body against this kind of damage is stimulated to action.\n\nEach of the organs that are part of the **blood** - **brain** communication system receives a chemical signal that warns it to react and respond when a poisonous substance contacts its tissue or membranes. This system consists of four parts:\n\n**1.** The nose, which sends a signal to one of the special parts of the brain, called the **limbic system**, telling it to react to **volatile** toxins in the air.\n\n**2.** The **lumbar nervous system**, which provides special protection in the abdomen and kidneys.\n\n**3.** The special protective systems in the mouth and eyes.\n\n**4.** The parts of the body responsible for excreting hazardous toxins.\n\nThese four systems are important to know about, because we must know how they work in ourselves so that we can make healthy decisions.\n\n**A.

{"text": "A photo of Marcel Zech's tattoo was taken at a small town on the coast of the Adriatic (where he lives most of year).\n\nMarcel is 55, he lives in a village, Zemunik - south from Rijeka. There he lives almost all year. He works as a painter in Rijeka. He has been interested in body art since his childhood, when he was a student at the high school in Rijeka.\n\nMarcel is not in the best of shape at the moment: he has been on vacation recently, and it seems as if the last few days of this month were not good days to him (travelling with friends - they rented their car but did not have a car at home, and had not a possibility to go to the other side of Montenegro because there was no car to rent where they are now).\n\nHe says that this has been a bad year for him regarding his health, and the beginning of his retirement: his last working contract had come to an end, he was retired officially from the last big project - this was a big ship, and he had done the finishing in the yard in Rijeka, but now he is on a voluntary basis for this job, and without pay.\n\nBut I am very curious about his tattoos, and I asked him for the name:\n\nThey are very beautiful and strange, because he did them one by one, bit by bit. When he got out of body, one is the tattoo in the photo. They show his inner world, his \"moods\", his memories of past events. At the moment they are mostly full with black, blue and red. I asked him to tell a bit about his process of getting to the present pictures, and he says:\n\nI always had this idea about the tattoo. But it was really expensive. So I had always to make compromises. So, I thought - maybe I should get a tattoo when he is almost dead. I could afford to get a single one - and it seemed to be a very good idea. I had always to accept that when the body is gone, it's the spirit that is permanent. I could get the tattoo even when I am alive, but I will no longer be able to paint. What is left after death is this: no more painting, no more creation, no more body.\n\nSo I was afraid I would not be able to create a soul after my death. What would happen to a soul if it has no body?\n\nI started in July this year. On the first day I started with a simple cross, black and blue. It was the best. Then I continued. I started from my right foot, so that there would be a sequence on the right, and there was my sister on the other side of my body. That was two weeks and at those times I was still capable of drawing.\n\nThen I have come to the left cheek, and another small painting with the same technique of black and blue. These two paintings are my \"likes\" for this tattoo, and that's where he got the black and blues from. I was so pleased. Even if he did not ask for colors...\n\nI never imagined that this color combination would stay. So I got four reds of the same coloration. It would be very beautiful on the right, but I did not have the courage to do that because there was so much to do there. I made a few sketches, but I did not get all of them. I started at the lower eyelid, and I drew very small. But when I was finished, they are very big.\n\nThis tattoo would be in a very large panel between the legs, and then I wanted the lower part of the legs to be black as well, and that was when I first tried to get the black. I was able to create in one piece, so I only had to draw a stroke between the black and the red. But that did not work. So I was almost finished with this, but then I was afraid that they would be no borders. So then I tried to add more, and in addition I added a black dot between his feet and the bottom. I realized that I would not be able to finish the whole work of this tattoo. This, then, was from four to five weeks.\n\nThen I tried to finish it in one day. I think I was successful in drawing a large cross over the left leg, the first time that I thought it would be possible. From there I thought maybe, if I paint something around it, it would not be visible.\n\nAnd then, at the upper right thigh, there was a red line that went to the back. The left thigh was drawn from the belly upwards to the knee, as well as the calf to be inked upwards so that it would be black as well.\n\nThen, one day, I thought", "label": 1, "id": 100421}
{"text": "the aim was to investigate the immunoreactivities for nos enzymes (nerve growth factor and synaptosomal associated protein 25) in the neuropil of the human substantia nigra and compare these results with those in the rat. For immunohistochemistry, cryostat sections of the human substantia nigra were used. Immunostaining was performed applying antisera against alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, gamma-synuclein, vesicular monoamine transporter 3 and dopamine active transporter. Anti-alpha-synuclein immunostaining revealed a strong immunolabeling in neuropil of the substantia nigra pars reticulata, while less intense alpha-synuclein immunostaining was observed in the pars compacta. Anti-ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 staining was only seen in the rat brain, the strongest staining being in the striatum. Anti-gamma-synuclein immunostaining was only observed in the rat brain, the strongest immunostaining being in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Anti-vesicular monoamine transporters 3 and dopamine-active transporter immunostainings revealed no reaction in the human and rat substantia nigra, indicating the specificity of these antisera. The human substantia nigra shows selective immunostaining for different components of the Lewy bodies. Since human and animal samples were compared by using the same antisera and procedures, an immunoreactivity for alpha-synuclein was detected in the human brain.

We think that there is a real opportunity to bring him back,\u201d said former Sen. Fred Thompson, who was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nMr. Thompson and his running-mate, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, say they hope to give the voters of Iowa the chance to get to know Mr. Gingrich and decide for themselves, even if it\u2019s in the name of vetting someone who knows what it takes to run a presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be the ultimate party choice,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cOur goal is to have fun, do something for a couple of weeks, to get as big a crowd as we can and have a good time doing it.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee is also concerned that the current field is too divisive. Committee Chairman Ed Rollins said it\u2019s important that all the candidates be able to appeal to a broad range of voters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave any part of the country out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get rid of these extremes at the end.

Instead, he said, the Republicans will \u201cput the country first, not our own particular, narrow-interest agenda.\u201d\n\nThe GOP field is getting narrower, and so are the poll standings. But the GOP is struggling with a major issue: the presidential primary calendar. The candidates need two things. First, they need to have name recognition. They can\u2019t get that through an Iowa straw poll. It\u2019s a long-shot that the eventual nominee gets much voter support that way. Second, they need to come to a consensus on selecting a candidate who can beat President Bush.\n\nThe question, according to GOP voters in the room, is how the candidates will address each of these issues. And how much of a priority is that in the minds of the party bosses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very serious. I think we all know who\u2019s going to be the nominee. But the other candidates need to decide where they want to be in three months, four months, six months,\u201d said John DeCamp, the former director of President George W. Bush\u2019s Hispanic outreach. \u201cAll the Republicans need to be focused on the country.\u201d\n\nMr. DeCamp said he didn\u2019t know much about any of the candidates. But he made it a point to show a photo of himself with Mr. Bush and to say he wanted \u201ca ticket in this general election that can help the next president.\u201d\n\nAnd if that means having a Republican president be the one to select Mr. Gingrich rather than anoint him himself, so be it.\n\n\u201cLet him be president all right. Let him be president for four years. He certainly has a way of talking about this country and about America that would make him an excellent president, but he cannot run for president from a House office,\u201d said Tom Keady, a former member of Congress from Pennsylvania who served with Mr. Gingrich.\n\nOther participants, like Rep. Dan Lungren, a California Republican, disagreed.\n\n\u201cI will be there to support and help this man because I know I can make a contribution.

Although it has not been used for background subtraction before, its presence can be easily taken into account\n\n-   the fact that the proton and electron spectra may be taken from measurements with a constant energy per proton/electron and different energy per electron.\n\n-   the difference in the average spectra for the soft x-ray and $\\gamma$-ray background. This difference between the two radiation fields can be taken into account by setting different parameters for the electron-ion cross section and the photon-ion cross section. When the electron-proton cross section is energy independent, a good approximation to the high energy part of the energy spectrum is the $2-3.9$Mev range while for the photon part a similar range is optimal.\n\n-   the possibility of a galactic cosmic ray contribution that may be considered as a diffuse soft x-ray, a $\\gamma$- ray and a hard x- ray background that can be subtracted.\n\nThe spectra we have obtained are dependent on the assumptions we have used. The resulting spectra are then used for estimating the impact of the background on the determination of the diffuse $\\gamma$- ray, diffuse x-ray and diffuse $\\gamma$-ray foreground emission by COMPTEL and EGRET.\n\nAcknowledgment\n==============\n\nWe like to thank T. Kifune for useful discussions.\n\nAppendix A\n==========\n\nHere we evaluate the integral in eq.\\[e:gammas\\] in the approximation in which $\\gamma_e \\gg \\gamma$:\n\nwhere we have introduced the electron number density and the plasma frequency of the hot electrons, using the electron density of the smooth ISM\n\nFor the evaluation of the integral one can make a change of variables according to\n\nwhere $\\eta$ can be interpreted as a distance and then $\\sigma_T$ in eq.\\[e:gammas\\] can be rewritten as\n\nThe first step is to approximate $P_0(m)$ as $m^{-2}$. It is then easy to see that in the approximation $A \\rightarrow 0$, i.e. the lower limit for the integration is infinite.\n\nThis is consistent if we note that for a Maxwellian spectrum the second moment is $\\langle  m^2\\rangle =1/3m^2$ (which coincides with eq.\\[e:a\\] for $p=2$ and $F(\\varepsilon_e\\varepsilon_i)$ given in eq.\\[e:b\\]). The electron number density is then given by the local ISM number density divided by $R$, the typical length for the source and thus the electron density will be at most $n_e \\sim 2$ times the local average ion density. Using this fact, the integral can be written as\n\nwith $$\\phi(\\varepsilon_i,", "label": 1, "id": 100426}
{"text": "I saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly entertained. It is a very simple plot--we have a young couple moving from one apartment to another, and then back, and finally we join them where we left them on the first level.\n\nThe second time I saw it, however, it was on television. And this time I actually had a chance to write the comments on the television, instead of leaving it as an afterthought.\n\nA few observations:\n\n1) If you are going to write a movie, don't leave out any clues and expect people to come up with your own ideas.\n\nHere is one clue--the boy is very tall. And he has the same coloring and same build as a man who lived there before the boy's mother was killed. The old man never mentioned it because he didn't recognize the boy when he saw him at an adult book store.\n\n2) The first time I saw the movie I was struck by the fact that there must be at least one old book out there which contains the names of all the old people depicted in the film. Since the director took the time to give us these names (who are all dead by the time they are \"appearing\" on the television), and since he was writing the book at the same time, he could also write the names of the characters in it.\n\nThe director has the old boy mention that he had been an editor of a book which the boy has been reading--this was not a clue, but it shows why it was probably necessary to make sure to have at least one character whose name was in the public literature--the editor's name should have been in the book.\n\nThis should not have been a puzzle to anyone, but it was.\n\n3) The book the boy is reading is called \"How to Get Along with Others,\" by William A. Ward. It's a book which has now been out of print for 40 or 50 years--so the boy doesn't just happen to know the author's name offhand.\n\nThe author was the only one who mentioned this name. He did so because he is one of the names on the title page of the book. The book which the boy is reading is not out of print.\n\nOf course the author is fictional--everybody's fiction is different, but his name is in fact fictional. And the book exists! In other words, a number of movies were filmed over the years which were very similar to the movie \"How to Get Along With Others.\"\n\nAnd when you're writing an article on movies written about real people, you can expect a few things to begin to be puzzling: for example, the book the author mentions as his own might not actually be out of print today. In other words, the fact he says it was \"out of print\" may simply be true today, but was not true years ago. Maybe the author's book was available in some form a very long time ago, but if the real author was writing about his own book then he would realize he was giving a clue which might actually be misleading.\n\n4) The plot: As the real world goes, if a young man and a young woman don't have a baby after they have been together for a while, and if they later want to get together again, they have no problem. They can go, and do it--for an example, the couple that had been in \"A Walk in the Springtime\"--the girl is in college where the boy is still in high school.\n\nThe boy never once mentions that she is older than he is (at least, not after she first mentioned her name), even at the end, where the boy says he liked looking at her. The only way the boy might have known about her age is if she'd mentioned it in some other context in the movie, and then he would then have understood she was older than him and would have understood what he was talking about. Which would have been a little bit difficult, considering he says \"but she was young.\"\n\nThe movie \"Little Men\" was written back in 1956--and by the end of the movie the boy is now in college and has just graduated, and the girl is married and has a grown-up child. The movie says there is another child (the girl's) somewhere. So what's the deal?\n\nI got myself into this one!\n\nHow do you suppose the girl was going to take the news of another child? (I mean it in a nice way.) By the end of the movie she's got a grown-up child! You don't expect people to just accept what the hero says!\n\nIt occurs to me that \"The Return of Frank James\" is a classic example of writing done to fill pages--or pages and pages and pages. It's very clever and very good writing, but, because it does not take up the time of the", "label": 1, "id": 100427}
{"text": "The crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, once a mainstay of the domestic market, became nearly extinct. Instead, they joined the ranks of outmoded and unwanted cars in the U.S. scrap heaps.\n\nBy the end of the decade, even big sedans were scarce. The last of the Big Three, General Motors, had only one new car named the Caprice. It looked like a Lincoln Continental. A Lincoln Continental!\n\nIt seemed to be the answer to the decade of the 1970s; a large, American car that could out-big-big itself. It looked like a larger version of the Ford Torino, and drove like a big car. It was built by a large company that prided itself on building huge cars. But not only would the Caprice never sell enough to stay in production, it became such an embarrassment to Lincoln, a brand with very little else, that they decided to discontinue it in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, Ford bought Chrysler outright. One might think that a company that big would make big cars, and instead the two biggest U.S. car companies went from selling 60% of all cars to selling 55% of all cars. Both had shrunk massively. To some, this seemed odd. The two major American car companies seemed to have lost their collective mojo. And indeed, they had.\n\nBut they were not alone. The American car industry, in the late 1970\u2019s and in the 1980\u2019s, was afflicted by a similar issue: the need for a \u201cnew American car\u201d to restore the industry\u2019s confidence. This is what the American car was supposed to be. And this is what happened.\n\nBy the mid-1970\u2019s the Chevrolet Vega was an anachronism. It had started as Ford\u2019s little people car but quickly became the butt of jokes. Its tiny engine and little payload were, apparently, the source of its bad reputation. It became one of America\u2019s last gas-burners.\n\nChevrolet also started selling a \u201cChevelle\u201d to replace its Chevette. It was built on a unibody frame, so it was much simpler to build than a conventional car and it was sold to many more buyers. But once again, the problem was the car itself.\n\nThe Chevelle was a disaster, and GM recalled the cars with itchy fingers.\n\nFor its part, Ford was trying to push the Mustang, and it seemed to be selling, but just selling. It became the best-selling car in America that year. But it also looked a little strange \u2014 almost like the new European cars, and not like a big, American car. Like the Vega and the Chevelle, something needed to give.\n\nIt could not be the Mustang\u2026 it was American. What about a smaller car, like a Camaro? And, if it was a small car, it should be as small as people, like the Vega and the Chevelle. So it was decided that the next American car would be \u201cthe small car\u201d with the small engine: the Camaro.\n\nIt would be big. It would be great. It would be the Chevrolet Camaro\u2026 and all the cars would be built on the same \u201cpinnacle\u201d unibody like the Chevelle.\n\nFord and GM, desperate for cash, were willing to bet the farm on this idea. By 1981 they had finally stopped building cars that they could name, and started building cars with numbers \u2014 the Chevy Citation and the Ford Bronco II. They called them the F-150 and the Bronco II, as if they were supposed to be big.\n\nIt didn\u2019t exactly work. The numbers were just numbers on a sheet of paper. No one really cared. The buyers were looking for something familiar \u2014 a car with a name. The cars were so big and lumbering that nobody really believed they \u201cgot it.\u201d The buyers walked away from the dealerships with the Camaro and never bought another Chevy car.\n\nWhen the car itself was recalled in 1989, it had become the poster-car for the Big Three\u2019s need to build big American cars.\n\nMeanwhile, other car companies, including Mercedes and Jaguar, were producing cars like Mercedes\u2019 300CE and Jaguars\u2019 E-Type, cars you\u2019d see in Germany or England. These were not big cars.\n\nEven with the numbers, buyers still wanted a big car in America. Ford and GM built a new, big car in 1991. It was a new nameplate \u2014 the Mustang. It was larger than it had been since the Edsel. It was bigger and more luxurious, but they called it the Mustang the way they called trucks \u201cHummer\u201d and boats \u201cPolaris.\u201d This, too, didn", "label": 1, "id": 100428}
{"text": "In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is owned with the owner's family or other members of their household. When the family member has died this makes the management of these properties that are of immense importance. In Uganda there are over a million of these family owned properties with around half of them lacking a properly defined management plan. This study was carried out to assess the importance of the owner's knowledge of their property's management requirements to the sustainability and development of their land.\n\nMaterials and methods {#sec1}\n=====================\n\nThis study was carried out between July 2015 and August 2016 at Masaka, Kanungu and Mubende districts of Uganda. Masaka district lies 50 kilometres south of Kampala in Central Uganda and Kanungu district is in the South Western part. Mubende district is located in the centre of Eastern Uganda and borders with Tanzania.\n\nPrior to this study, the survey team carried out a detailed mapping of each district as well as local government administration to prepare for data collection. The study population consisted of all the family and household heads who had their property within the district. An information meeting on a general topic related to property management was held in each district to explain the study to the owners. The study team included eight trained surveyors who visited each house-hold that had a property or land. The study team asked the heads whether they had a property management plan (PMP). If the answer was given \"no\" or the respondent did not answer this question the interviewer proceeded with the rest of the questions on demographics, ownership of the property and tenure, PMPs, and the owner-manager's role. The interviewers used a questionnaire that was created for the study. Questionnaires were translated from English into the local language and pre-tested among people owning properties with very similar characteristics. In each household the study team interviewed the head of the household. During the main survey interviews, we sought clarifications from interviewees if needed. The interviews were carried in privacy with the assistance of a translator. The owners, mainly heads of household, were contacted when necessary to clarify questions. The interviewers sought clarifications when an owner gave an ambiguous answer that may have needed interpreting.\n\nThe ownership of land refers to the right to use, own, own and dispose, of land or an area within a district. In this study we use the definition of land developed by [@bib11], that is, the physical part of the land used for human activities; as well as the part that is under the control of a person. Also within this definition there are no restrictions on the term property. A property refers to any land or building that can be owned, whether private or public, but excludes national (owned or used state assets).\n\nProprietors in this study include the owners and the managers, which are usually the heads of the family, while the manager may have different roles within different families. For example, a manager might be the first to use the land and has the responsibility of keeping the land in a condition good for its use. Another could be a responsible farm employee who looks after and cultivates the land.\n\nAfter the completion of the interview, study forms were left at the premises in order to be completed later if required, in the same way the participants were reminded via text messages, telephone calls and/or visits. This was done to encourage the participants to come back with the information sheets that were left at the property.\n\nIn each district we used a probability proportionate to size sampling method to choose three districts. We also did a random selection of three communities within the chosen study districts. This ensured a distribution across the districts and different levels of government areas; therefore giving a sample from rural, peri urban and urban settings.\n\nData management and analysis {#sec1.1}\n----------------------------\n\nData entry was done using EpiData version 3.1 and cleaned and exported to STATA version 12. Descriptive socio- demographics for age, sex, socio-economic class, and ownership of the property were explored. Furthermore, the ownership was disaggregated into land ownership and housing ownership. In most settings ownership of the property could be disaggregated into the following categories: public, private and family and households. In this study the ownership of the land was disaggregated into private and family and households.\n\nData quality was maintained by checking for completeness and entered, cleaned and exported to STATA version 12 for analysis. Univariate and Multivariate logistic and linear regression tests were applied to explore the significant factors associated with ownership of PMP.\n\nThe study was approved by the National Council for Science and Technology in Uganda, and the Makerere University School of Public Health Higher Degrees Research and Ethics Committee.\n\nResults {#sec2}\n=======\n\nThe study population consisted of all the family and household heads who had their properties with the district.

{"text": "Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: more personal attention from their teachers, smaller class sizes, superior academic support and a wide range of extra-curricular activities. However, they face many hurdles for being financially self-sufficient. Not only do they need to pay for the tuition costs, they also incur additional costs like uniforms, school fees, transport and lunches.\n\nIt\u2019s true that private schools still make a great investment in children\u2019s social and educational development. However, you can cut the costs involved with a private school education right now if you know where you can invest, how much you can save, and the right timing.\n\nFind out more in the following article.\n\nHow to Get the Best Value for Your Money from Your Private School\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right high school, choosing one that can teach your child the things they\u2019ll need for an impressive career in the future will mean the best value and long term savings. If you believe that a private school can provide your child with all of this and you still want the best value for your money, there are certain tactics you can take.\n\nThe best way to do this is to identify your priorities and then look for the best private high school. Here is how to choose the best public high school:\n\nWhat do you want your child to learn?\n\nThe first thing you need to do when choosing a high school is determine what kind of education you want for your child, as it plays a huge part in the final result. If your child wants to make a career in medicine you, for example, it can\u2019t be a bad idea to go to the best med school. This can also vary from person to person and location to location because of various reasons.\n\nIf you work with a private school and it specializes in a field of study, like education, computer science, music and so on, then you will most likely be investing money into their courses such as technology, English, and other general education topics. This often creates more demand when hiring graduates for the kind of jobs you\u2019re looking for.\n\nFind an appropriate private high school\n\nFinding a great school can be a tedious job, but there are ways to make it easier. Many private high schools have websites and often students can compare each school online to see where each school measures up. A really good website to help with this comparison is School Choice, a site dedicated to helping students, families and schools navigate the education system safely and effectively. You can also find schools yourself by visiting your local Department of Education website.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to talk to other parents who are choosing private high schools and use their knowledge to help you make an informed decision.\n\nHow Much Will You Save?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided what type of education you\u2019re interested in, you\u2019re going to have to factor into the decision whether to invest in a private high school or public school. When it comes to the choice between public and private high school, the choice should come down to affordability.\n\nThe price of a private school education has risen throughout history. However, it is important not to assume that you\u2019ll save more money with a private high school simply because you need to invest more financially for the same amount of time.\n\nIf your child enters school at the primary or secondary level they\u2019re usually eligible to apply for an Australian School Uniform Scholarship. However, the Scholarship doesn\u2019t always help you save the most money.\n\nThe number of school uniforms can often vary for public and private. For example, private schools will often provide their students with uniforms. On the other hand, there can be times when private schools cannot afford these uniforms, so this can contribute to a higher cost.\n\nWhat are the different types of Private High Schools?\n\nThere are many different types of private high schools:\n\n\u2022 Co-educational \u2013 Co-educational schools are just that, they have both boys and girls in the school. They may offer a mixed-gender program but they have separate buildings for students of both sexes and they may also have the option to separate to individual campuses for single gendered or all-male or all-female schools.\n\n\u2022 Girls-only \u2013 This is where boys are not permitted inside or it\u2019s for all girls and it costs more, typically. They have separate buildings, separate staff and different curriculum. Girls only schools should be preferred over co-ed schools if you value the female role model. However private high schools may be more expensive than public schools.\n\n\u2022 Preschools \u2013 When it comes to private high schools the pre-schooling stage can take a number of different forms. It\u2019s an age that is not regulated anywhere in the world, but it is also regarded as a \u201cpre-K\u201d period usually in elementary", "label": 1, "id": 100431}

Only 9.1 million Nintendo 3DSes (not counting the New 3DS XL) were sold by the end of March, which is a low number even accounting for the system's increased production output.

Hayden (now President Obama\u2019s director of the National Counterterrorism Center), Jose Rodriguez and George W. Bush\u2019s former deputy national security adviser, Michael J. Gerson.\n\nThough it has been alleged in the past that the US government is involved in numerous unlawful detention centers globally, including in Afghanistan, Yemen and Pakistan, the report details some of the first-hand accounts of the treatment US prisoners across the Middle East, Asia and Africa received at its custody.\n\nThe report includes allegations of beatings, sleep deprivation, forced nudity, prolonged isolation, extreme temperature, solitary confinement and stress positions. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nThe list also includes some specific dates, like 10/22/2001, which is when the infamous CIA black site rendition flight that included CIA torturer and chief of interrogations, Ali Soufan was flown to Romania.\n\nThe most obvious question: is any official responsible for these egregious abuses? Will American taxpayers be held accountable for years of torture.\n\n\u201cThis report is the most compelling evidence to date of the CIA\u2019s use of coercive interrogation against detainees,\u201d said Chris Anders, the deputy director of National Security Programs at the ACLU (Americans United for Liberties) and a co-author of the report.\n\nThe ACLU said the report reveals \u201ca dark history of detention and interrogation practices that have only come to light as more public attention has been paid to the CIA in connection to the abuse of other prisoners like Jose Padilla and Abu Zubaida.\u201d \u201cThis torture program was a stain on the national honor that was covered up, but must never be allowed to happen again,\u201d said Jay S. Bybee, former associate deputy attorney general and a member of the legal advice group that designed the interrogation tactics.\n\nThe report further states that the program was never reviewed by a judge, had no internal oversight within the CIA, and there seems to be a great disconnect between former CIA leaders and current policy makers.\n\n\u201cWe have identified a pattern of misconduct and bad judgment that makes clear the need for a serious criminal investigation,\u201d said Phillip Nash, a senior investigative fellow in the Project on Government Oversight at the Cato Institute and an adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nAccording to Nash and the report, CIA employees who questioned the harsh interrogation program\u2019s legality were ignored and ostracized and even the report\u2019s co-author, former ACLU official, Jay Bykom has received death threats and bomb threats.\n\nThe report also details how the Justice Department and then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzalez misled Congress and hid some of the information on the interrogation programs.\n\n\u201cThe report documents the CIA\u2019s extensive efforts to prevent detainees from obtaining habeas corpus relief, with the DOJ and White House both involved in the misrepresentations,\u201d said Mark Doss, a spokesperson for the ACLU.\n\nEven now, five years after the report\u2019s initial release, Bush and Dick Cheney are still protecting the agency responsible for those abuses from public accountability.\n\n\u201cIt is an outrage,\u201d added Nash, that the Bush-era Justice Department and the White House continue to prevent the public from knowing about the interrogation programs.\u201d At a time when we should be doing everything we can to prevent another attack, we\u2019re stuck in a bureaucratic morass in which only the top of the administration knows what really happened.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the ACLU now finds itself in an even worse situation as Attorney General Eric Holder has gone to court to defend the CIA\u2019s secret prisons. So, one might ask where does this investigation\u2019s findings of torture programs stand among the legal process of the Justice Department?\n\nHere\u2019s where it stands according to the New York Times:\n\nBy early 2010, lawyers at the Justice Department said that the CIA was violating the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting a detainee to treatment that amounted to simulated drowning and slammed his head against a wall, according to a classified 2010 internal Justice Department memorandum.

The media was incubated aerobically at 37 \u00baC and 5% carbon dioxide to detect obligate anaerobes. Identification of organisms was based on visual, gram stain, colony morphology, biochemical tests, and susceptibility testing as per guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, USA.

Staphlococcus aureus was isolated from each side of ethmoid sinus.\n\nAntibiotic sensitivity was carried out as per procedures recommended by disc and zone of inhibition measurement. After initial intravenous antibiotic therapy of 10days with Vancomycin (1gm every12 hours) and Amikacin (1gm every24hrs), patient showed no improvement clinically and radiologically, so subsequently broad-spectrum anaerobic coverage was added including metronidazole (500mg every 3hours) and meropenem (1gm every 8hours) for 15days.

On examination, a cystic swelling that extended from left to right was seen in maxillary sinus with a pedunculated cystic mass in right maxillary sinus; the swelling filled the intraorbital ethmoidal cells and extended to the medial wall of infratemporal fossa. No other deformity was detected. X-ray was suggestive of opacification of maxillary sinus with the cyst in both sinuses.\n\nOn laboratory examination of the material from the cystic mass, shematologic investigations along with biochemical analyses were normal.

{"text": "Bowerman had wanted to be a doctor, but couldn't afford medical school. Instead he taught at a tiny high school in Oregon and wrote an op-ed in the _New York Times_ about the plight of poor kids. The op-ed came out just as the magazine _Life_ was planning a series on poor kids in American schools, and Bowerman convinced them to let him write for them. Soon the company started sending Bowerman out to interview children and do profiles on their lives. It would become one of the greatest legacies of The Oregon Project, and its most celebrated story, yet he took a year out of it to travel alone through Russia in 1978. Then he returned home with a new outlook on life and a lot of new stories of the children he had met on his travels.\n\nAt the end of that year, Bowerman sold a piece to a magazine called _Backpacker_ called the article of which is called \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" It was the first of his many expos\u00e9s of what American kids were actually doing for one another. He followed that up with \"The Great School Heist of America,\" a series of stories about the children working in a soup kitchen in Boston, the most famous for its image of four children stealing a loaf of bread from a store on Saturday morning. Then, before he graduated from high school, he wrote a magazine called _Sesame Street_ and told more than sixty stories about children on the streets of New York City.\n\nA lot of these stories are told by other people. Bowerman's take on them tends to be a bit more vivid, with long stretches of first-person narration that seem to give more detail than the stories themselves. But I think the best way to understand the world of the kids he wrote about was by attending high school with them: in _Boys of Blue Ribbon High_, the narrator attends the same school, and the kids are pretty much their age. So by reading that book, it's like reading an account of the world through the eyes of real kids.\n\n**JON SHAWN:**\n\nThere's a lot of things about this book that you'll know. He's one of your favorite writers, and there's something going on in Portland in the early '70s where one of the greatest basketball players ever comes into being. When he first came onto the scene, a lot of people weren't as friendly about sports as they have become. He grew up being a pretty good basketball player at a time when a lot of people didn't like him as an athlete and didn't like it when he started talking about things that the average boy wouldn't, or shouldn't.\n\nOne of the things that he had to do for all the attention from talking so much about things that his peers didn't want to talk about was that he had to start talking to them. When he was really young, he made a commitment to start hanging out outside of basketball and start doing activities that didn't happen in the typical boyhood of the times. People told him that his approach wasn't a good business strategy, but there was a lot of stuff he was telling the kids about things they needed to be good kids about, so even though they were saying he wasn't good at what he was doing, he was really doing something important. Some of the stuff he talked about to the kids wasn't the typical stuff that most parents were talking to you about.\n\nWhen John went back and was writing this book, he was going back and talking to a lot of these same kids. I was able to go back to high school and I got to meet him and talk to him as a writer, trying to get a feel of exactly what he was talking about.\n\n**JONAH LEARN:**\n\nI'm lucky that I knew him. I'm lucky that I went to high school with him, because that was definitely a moment in time. He was somebody that I would go to with advice, and there were a lot of kids like that. He wrote about some of the kids from other high schools and other cities, but I don't think that he covered everybody. If I was going to be a writer and I was trying to figure out where to start talking about my own life as a kid and what a kid growing up in this era would be like living, I would call John one of three. That would be James Lipton from New York, I would put John into the category of writing from another time and place, and the third would be someone that I would call the _Portland Tribune_.

{"text": "I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be part of a cycle of seven American films on the topic of the space program, which explains why it was released, to the general populace, as a featurette on The Man in Space. It is certainly one of the more forgettable of its cohort and even the cast is mostly interchangeable (George Kennedy for instance is a character actor, so a lot of his presence has to be supplied by the script). It also has that famous \"wanting to be there\" feeling about it, the same \"wanting to be at that special place\" as those other films, like Conquest of Space or We Can Build You, do as they get deeper into space travel and the possibility that astronauts can one day travel to the planets, but it never really comes together. A good part of this is that, even as an actor, Kennedy is somewhat wooden and is hamstrung by his surroundings in a lot of scenes. The problem is the script itself.\n\nWhat should have made for an interesting film is the idea of what happens when these people live, not just for six months, but six years in a space capsule. We learn in the movie that these people are not as prepared as they might have thought, in other words, they have never been in space before and the result is that their personal relationships suffer, they become bored, and, most likely, one or more of the astronauts suffers hallucinations. These hallucinations, like the ones in 2001, are not of other-worldly, but instead of people from their past. All of this is very easy to accept as real in a movie like this (but not so easy in 2001 since the main character was not a hallucination, he was quite real). The problem is, that it could be real and it is certainly something one experiences when living on a space station, not like 2001 where the characters are just projections made by the alien force.\n\nSo what we get is an astronaut who loses the people in his life and goes nuts for some months. He does go back home after six months, but as Kennedy himself says when he is interviewed for a space-related magazine, \"It's not the same. We were apart a long time and I won't say that it was the best thing I ever did\u2014but it was the right thing for a young man such as myself. I couldn't have accomplished my goals without the experience.\" Of course, he has also grown to appreciate his first space voyage and, even though his family will be disappointed in his absence, he is content being alone, with no need to see anyone.\n\nThe movie is so poorly cast and the script is so clunky that it is hard to believe he did not know how bad it would be and the few parts that have a certain amount of charm, such as an early scene in which Kennedy and his boss, Major Johnstone (Arthur Franz), discuss the possibility of a long voyage where the astronauts have some down time at the cost of a mission; or an extended shot of the space mission which shows one of Kennedy's hallucinations in vivid Technicolor of his wife, Susan (Joan Freeman), in the 1960s, when he was still alive. It seems an odd choice by the director (George McCowan), however, to use the 1960s as a backdrop to the present instead of showing the present as an alternative to 1960. After all, what if the astronaut had gotten back and a decade had passed?\n\nEven with a few small pieces of charm, the film does not work very well and the last half hour drags like molasses.\n\nAnd I am really bothered by the fact that there was a man who wrote that movie. In what universe does such a script come from? It never had a future as a film.\n\nBut this is a documentary, with one side of the story told in archival footage, interviews and home movies, so it is the story from the perspective of an engineer and an astronaut who talks about their experience. From time to time, it uses narration, but mostly, it is just dialogue between these guys and the history that has surrounded them since they were born. And the result is some of the most moving and fascinating home movies that are out there.\n\nWhen we get to the story, we are at Edwards Air Force Base, on the edge of the Mojave desert, and about 20 years before this video was shot. We see the first of the four space stations that were built in the U.S. in the 1950s. NASA was so impressed with these stations in orbit that they ordered two more. The other two were built without major funding and are known as the two \"boogers\" of NASA, meaning that they are just giant balls that seem to serve no purpose at the time and are not even really part of the space program as much as a means of keeping the astronauts fit and sane.

However, these results are difficult to extrapolate to the postoperative course or to chronic conditions. Intriguingly, no randomized control trials are available evaluating the role of the subdural space. Although there has been a report of successful reduction of chronic intracranial space occupying lesions with a subdural balloon catheter \\[[@B11]\\], the use of a balloon catheter to evacuate chronic subdural hematomas has never been reported. Herein, we have used a balloon catheter for evacuation and have achieved successful drainage in a patient with a large chronic subdural hematoma. The patient was kept under an intensive care setting with careful management of her airways and anticoagulation regimen. If the patient has a life-threatening condition, the possibility of hemorrhage from the surgical wound should be considered. Also, there is a possibility of infection in the subdural space; therefore, it is essential to monitor the patient for such complications. The patient in this case was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis based on transthoracic echocardiography, and, at that time, her cardiac status could not be assessed. The perioperative management was a challenge for us. In addition, her aortic stenosis was not resolved after surgery; therefore, anticoagulation was discontinued during postoperative follow-up. The patient received no thrombolysis or thrombectomy treatments because of the possible risk of bleeding. She continued to receive anticoagulation without thrombolytic therapy despite a large subdural hematoma and a risk of aortic thrombotic occlusion. The risk of thrombotic occlusion of cerebral vessels should be considered to treat a large subdural hematoma with anticoagulation.\n\nIn this case, the patient had a cardiac history of aortic stenosis and was on chronic anticoagulation. However, the decision of not administering heparin was based on the concern of the patients\\' severe condition with potential life-threatening complications. The decision to continue anticoagulation postoperatively was based on the possible risk of hemorrhage from surgical wounds due to low heparin concentrations in the postoperative period. There is a concern that the size of the lesion gradually increases on the postoperative course; however, no other signs of acute hemorrhage were presented in this case.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn this report, we have described a case of a large chronic subdural hematoma that was successfully treated with a subdural catheter and heparin. In the setting of acute subdural hematoma evacuation after spontaneous brain injury, subdural balloon catheters are a valuable adjunct tool. This case also provides new information on the subdural space. Subdural balloon catheters can be used for acute evacuation or chronic hematomas as well as for evacuation of the subdural space with subdural hematomas.\n\nConsent\n=======\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

If you are using them, rinse the tomatoes under water, then drain them and add them to the pot. Stir them frequently throughout the process.\n\nMake sure you have enough water at the bottom of the pot. You want the bottom three inches or so of water to be simmering, not bubbling.\n\nYou can add any ingredients you'd like. As always, the main goal is to reduce the sodium.\n\n[3]\n\nIf you'd like to add meat to this recipe, look at the other variations we included (especially the low-sodium one).\n\nHow can you adjust the fat, and reduce the sodium?\n\n[4]\n\nA low-sodium tomato soup can be made in many ways. You can add as little or as much fat as you'd like. You could, for example, omit the oil from the onions, as some people prefer, or you could add less sodium-reducing ingredients.\n\nOne way you could add some fat is to blend onions with the liquid from a can (or use part or all of a drained can to get the liquid). You could also try using oil instead of onions to saut\u00e9 them. You could also use fat-free sour cream or crumbled feta (or try a different cheese to lower the fat) to enhance the flavor. Note that all these changes to the recipe would, in and of themselves, increase the fat.\n\nYou probably shouldn't do a low-fat recipe as is. Because low-fat recipes tend to be low in both water and flavor, they're often oversweet. You'd have to balance low fat with high sodium to keep the texture and flavor.\n\nHow can you cut the fat?\n\nThe fat you add to tomato soup is often cream or half-and-half. These are commonly used to make tomato soup lighter and/or creamier. (Note that \"light cream\" is often the same as \"half-and-half\" or \"heavy cream\".) These fats are usually used as a flavoring or as a way to boost the flavor of the soup rather than to cut the amount of fat. Reducing the amount of cream or fat that is added gives you a smoother soup.\n\nHere are a few ways you could reduce the amount of fat used.\n\nMake the soup taste rich and fatty. You can do this by using the rich flavor and fat of heavy cream or half-and-half. The problem with doing this is that it means you'll need to use more than you did if you added more water, reducing the overall number of calories in your recipe.[5]\n\nYou could try half-and-half instead of cream. This has a distinct flavor compared to cream and tastes much richer. Unlike most soups, you can easily use less fat with half-and-half than you can with cream. (In fact, half-and-half might have no fat at all!)\n\nYou can use a smaller amount of high-fat cream. For example, if you were using a half-and-half and half-and-half combination, you could use less one of the other in your recipe to keep the fat content at the original level.\n\nSince cream has a lot of fat and calories, it should be in smaller quantities while still giving you the flavor and richness you desire. Also, it has a bad reputation for being too rich. Thus, half-and-half might be a better option, as it tastes better and is usually lower in calories.\n\nAdd salt water to a thin layer at the bottom of the pot. After you've cooked the onions, return some of the water at the bottom of the saut\u00e9 pan to the pot and add a small amount of salt. You won't be adding a lot of sodium, but it will certainly reduce the sodium in your recipe!\n\nMix 1/8 teaspoon of salt to 1-1/2 cups of water. Using this technique should give you a sodium reduction that won't completely mask the other natural flavors in the soup.\n\nThis technique might not work too well in a recipe that relies on the other natural flavors in tomatoes to mask a lot of the sodium.\n\nYou might be able to use a blend of a few techniques; try them all to see what works best for you.\n\nYou can substitute another form of salt for the granulated or table salt. For example, you can try finely ground", "label": 1, "id": 100444}
{"text": "Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston, a walkable area on Boston\u2019s northern periphery close to Fenway Park and Harvard and Tufts Medical Schools. The land that is being purchased is part of \u201cAllston\u2019s Great Green Space,\u201d an open space that runs for almost 9 miles from just west of Tufts\u2019 medical campus to a parcel that is home to a number of schools.\n\nThese \u201cGreat Green Spaces\u201d include the Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway, a former trolley line that runs through one of the city\u2019s more walkable neighborhoods. This land will be developed into affordable residences and a new street, which will eventually run right through the heart of Allston from Medford St. to Commonwealth Ave. The land being purchased runs along Commonwealth Ave. through Allston, with Harvard, Boston College\u2019s medical school, and the new Harvard Medical School building located at the western side of the parcel.\n\nAt its closest to Medford St. the land that will be developed stretches out into the former site of Allston Landing, a mixed-use, publicly funded project that was envisioned as a transit-oriented mixed-use development. It now is being redeveloped as a much lower density housing project known as Allston Landing. Much of this development is being funded via the sale of public land and the federal and state Low Income Tax Credits.\n\nIn his announcement of the purchase, the university stated that the land being purchased is a portion of \u201ca larger property that includes the [Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway],\u201d and will be \u201ca new extension of Commonwealth Avenue, a linear park that will connect the Allston Landing project to the Medical School.\u201d This extension will run from the existing Medford St. overpass, through the Medford St. Station, which will run under the Greenway to provide vehicular access, and through Fenway Park to the proposed Medford Street Station near the Medical Admits building. Along the way, it will intersect with other public right of ways, including the \u201cPierce Road Greenway, a pedestrian connection from Medford Street to the Allston-Brighton Trolley Greenway.\u201d\n\nFenway Park, shown at the far western end of the land being purchased. Photo: Google Street View.\n\nIf I had to guess (and my gut is not my best guide in this case), I imagine the purchase price will be about $4.5 million, and be funded through a combination of proceeds generated from the sale of the public lands, state Low Income Tax Credits, and other unspecified financial supports. A small portion of the land purchase price will be allocated to the \u201cpurchase of an Allston/Brighton Greenway trolley,\u201d likely with a view to the eventual construction of a station at the Medford St. Greenway overpass.\n\nThe Allston Community Planning & Development (APD) agency will be undertaking environmental review of construction and neighborhood impacts. This will likely be followed by the APD\u2019s approval of plans for Allston Landing, and will hopefully be tied into the larger planning process for the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA).\n\nAccording to a Boston Globe article regarding the land sale, \u201c[t]he sale will help Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh close a budget deficit, and provide funds to start construction on the state's first new medical school in nearly half a century.\u201d\n\nThis is just one of the examples of this kind of large public land sale and development project that Boston is experiencing on the edge of its neighborhoods and in the heart of major public parks.\n\nThe \u201cGreat Green Space\u201d will be part of a much larger plan on the edge of Allston and the bordering neighborhood of Brighton. In 2016 the city of Boston released a report and plan for the area, but few specifics of their recommendations have been revealed. According to the city\u2019s report, that \u201cthe neighborhood\u2019s public amenities\u201d are \u201cthe core components of [that] plan.\u201d This \u201cpublic amenities\u201d include parkland and green space, and the expansion or improvement of \u201chousing,\u201d and \u201cretail.\u201d\n\nThe parkland is currently home to the newly renovated Eliot Pond Park. The pond has also been expanded in size through a project financed by the City. More parkland is under construction as part of the larger Eliot Pond Park Greenway Extension project, which will run right through this and surrounding land. This project will be a \u201ca linear park that will connect the Allston Landing project to the Medical School.\u201d But, because it is a part of the Greater Boston Greenway, it is being completed at the same time as the Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway, an existing transit-oriented, linear greenway running", "label": 1, "id": 100445}
{"text": "The ECB committed to injecting at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1 trillion (\u00c2\u00a3834bn) of liquidity into the eurozone banking system. And the Bank of England followed suit by pledging as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac750bn.\n\nYet a senior executive at Germany\u2019s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, says: \u201cThe ECB could do no more. They do not have money to lend.\u201d\n\nThere is one last issue to address. The IMF \u2013 which is not an independent institution \u2013 says that the financial sector could run out of money if the European Central Bank extends money to the core economies, such as Germany and France, at a speed and scale that dwarfs its existing emergency support programmes. It says this could lead to a collapse of the lending markets and a credit crunch.\n\nThe Fund also says that if governments impose fiscal austerity, the damage to private credit markets in these areas could turn into a global crisis.\n\nAnd finally, the IMF says that European governments will have to be prepared to \u201cdisclose their fiscal policies by 1 July 2013\u201d, because the international bailout scheme will have to be revised by the end of this month.\n\nThe consequences could be far-reaching, even for Germany. The Federal Reserve\u2019s vice-chairman, Daniel Tarullo, is due to visit Greece as part of his European circuit. If that trip goes ahead \u2013 and the IMF believes it could happen this coming Monday \u2013 it would send an even further powerful signal that a bailout programme is about to be finalised. For Germany, especially, this would be a bitter pill.\n\nThe IMF is right to press the case for Europe\u2019s governments to do more to ensure that there are no new crises. But its response to the recent Greek debt writedown does not necessarily address the fundamental problem they face.\n\nThe IMF says that the private-sector exposure of eurozone banking systems to Greek debt amounts to \u20ac50.1bn, equivalent to 23 per cent of their outstanding loans. And it says there are a further \u20ac2.6 trillion of bonds issued by eurozone countries with similar obligations to Greece.\n\nThe Fund says that European governments should support their banks by injecting funds directly and by raising their deposit insurance limits so that they can fund the cost or write off the losses on this debt. Under the present circumstances, that means either a reduction in public debt \u2013 which is unaffordable for eurozone states at present \u2013 or a large and immediate rise in taxes.\n\nSuch decisions are not easy to make. But the alternative of a default on this debt could plunge the world\u2019s economies into a deflationary spiral.\n\nThe crisis in Europe\u2019s banking system is not the same as the financial crisis in 2007-8 when the US and other countries were saved from collapse by a bailout of Wall Street that was provided by both the US government and by the euro. The situation is different.\n\nFirstly, the crisis in the euro is the consequence of the single currency\u2019s inherent failure. It is not caused by banks lending recklessly, except where that has contributed to the crisis through a combination of an economic boom fuelled by cheap money and loose lending, and then a bust of unsustainable credit growth. Secondly, the banks of eurozone countries all have to be recapitalised by their governments. That is entirely different from the Wall Street rescue where the private sector was kept whole. The US government had no responsibility for the insolvency of Wall Street; and the German government will have no responsibility, at present, for the insolvency of its own banks.\n\nWhat concerns me is the fact that it seems the eurozone has turned its back on a fiscal union which would allow it to have an automatic stabilising mechanism in place within a year. I would be fascinated to hear the views of George Osborne and others around the European Union on this one. Would it not be possible for the euro to move away from having a purely technocratic executive board that is responsible for dealing with the issue? The Germans seem to have an unhealthy love of technocratic solutions. Perhaps they are now waking up to what a disaster the euro project has been. In a few days it will be a year since the Irish decided not to join the euro. There is little evidence that the consequences have been discussed at the highest level, with the consequence of an emergency meeting at some point in the next few weeks. Perhaps the crisis could be tackled in that forum. But, having decided to create the euro, it would have been useful to find a solution. Perhaps now will be the time for the other member states to discuss what this union will look like, and who should pay the membership fee to join.", "label": 1, "id": 100446}

{"text": "A fabulous book about a fox and his family who have lived amongst humans for some years - the idea that they'll be caught is beyond doubt. But there's trouble with the local farmers - who want to make the village less attractive to humans - and their plot has just been uncovered. There's an attempt to capture the fox and take him back to a zoo where the cages are very tight and it's likely he'll die - what can the fox do to save himself? And what will happen to the humans in the meantime? Fantastic characters - I really liked them - and a marvellous read as well as being an easy and fascinating story to follow.\n\nI love these characters, as I love all the books by Richard Adams - I think I've read all the novels and the collections. I think I'd better not ask what books are in this series - although I often ask what the book is from my collection when they ask for recommendations! I'll just say that it was a splendid book. Absolutely marvellous.\n\nI'd read some of Richard Adams' other books before this one, like Last Days, but I didn't know much about the characters or what the book was about. I'm glad I picked this up first and found out more while I was reading the rest of the series - it's probably that - because they are all so well-written and the characters are so likeable. Adams writes about a fox called Benjamin, who is just coming into his own as a character. He's the only fox of four brothers and has the misfortune - or the talent - of being the only one the humans like. Ben is clever and enjoys the benefits of being at the centre of all the human attention they bring him. He finds out that, when he comes up for sale, it's because the neighbouring farmer plans to sell him to an animal circus or safari and ship him off to a zoo, and he and his brothers fight their best to escape. They manage to avoid capture in plenty of time and, luckily, all four survive through the years - there's no way for a fox so used to living with humans to escape now - and are taken to the zoo. Here's where their troubles really start and I loved every minute of the story - Adams does have some great comic scenes - about when a new animal keeper comes in and all his own staff know each other anyway and don't bother him when animals need attention. Benjamin finds a way to escape again and returns to the humans, then he starts working out the secrets of their lives - who likes each other and who doesn't, how they live, what they do for each other etc. He discovers the humans are not as wonderful as they seem and their problems are not over in a hurry.\n\nTo summarise: this is another really good series. I like that Adams has written it in the language we have in real life. It is easy for adults and children to read and understand and the characters are so human. Well done, Richard, and thanks for another wonderful series.\n\nWhat I didn't know before beginning the latest Thomas Holt book was that it was an ongoing series about a fox and his friends in a village in Scotland until he is taken to the zoo. I didn't much like this at first - it was much too realistic, more like an actual story rather than a novel. I'm glad I picked it up and decided to give it another try though - it grew on me as I kept reading and, of course, soon realised that it's a series of books rather than a standalone and has been going for a long time. I think this is because the authors are so interested in all the characters' lives - even in the main story in this book - and they aren't just trying to make money out of this or get readers or anything else. Every story about the animals at the zoo becomes part of the main one. Some humans are more important to the animals than others - that's understandable, because they need the animals for company and amusement and to make a living anyway. All of the characters have interesting back stories and the main story isn't so serious - it shows the main animals as really good at escaping and how it's all done.\n\nThere are three characters we follow throughout the series: the fox, Benjamin, a hedgehog called Sniff and a guinea pig called Scruffy who sometimes joins in as they try to get away. Benjamin is about eleven in this book and he is getting quite strong and strong-minded. He's starting to work out which humans don't like each other as much as he thinks they do, and where this is in the village from where they live, who will like each other most and who might not. Benjamin wants to find out whether what he knows isn't true - that animals like the humans and feel more at ease with them. But his parents tell him to do some simple human things, rather than try to break out of every cage they live in, so their", "label": 1, "id": 100448}
{"text": "To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River; to the north are the peaks of the Sangre de Cristos and the San Juan Mountains; to the west and south are the Great Plains and its famous wind tunnels. It wasn a perfect place for two college guys to find refuge from civilization. It was more like a place of refuge from the people, a place of solitude and tranquility. And that was fine with them.\n\nOne spring, just after graduation, I traveled to New York City to attend a college fair there. The college of my dreams was one of the booths set up at the fair. They even had a tour group take the students through the college. I got a glimpse of the campus that night. I fell in love with the place, so I drove home as fast as I could to tell my parents.\n\nMy dad asked, \u201cWhy New York?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I want to go to the college,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat college?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can always come with me to New York to visit if you want to,\u201d I said.\n\nHe took my hand and said, \u201cThat\u2019s true, son. You can come to New York if you want and we\u2019ll visit the college. When, not if.\u201d\n\nLife had turned upside down for the two of us. My mom found it even harder because I had left her hometown and my two brothers, ages nine and seven, were all on their own. She worried that I was setting myself up for failure. But I wasn\u2019t. Instead, I had set myself up for success. She worried I\u2019d be an empty, lonely, miserable twenty-year-old just like my father had been at fifteen. Again, I told her to go, \u201cthat\u2019s true, but you\u2019ll be able to see your grandchildren.\u201d\n\nI called my mom every Sunday on her birthday. I loved her, but I loved my dad more. And she knew it. Whenever I talked to her, it was like she already knew what was going to happen (she didn\u2019t, of course, but we were all a little crazy).\n\nDad, too.\n\nI knew what I was in for right away. While I was gone a few nights a week, Mom and Dad ate dinner alone every night. They had each other. But they were different somehow. He was always alone at dinner; she was always with people (that\u2019s one way she was different from me). Dad would talk about the guys I played soccer with, which helped him deal with missing me while I was gone. I think he missed me as well, but he was too busy doing it for both of us.\n\nAt the end of a long phone conversation with my mom, she always said, \u201cCall me on my birthday\u201d. By that time, it was getting late at night, and I didn\u2019t want to call at all. But I wanted to call because she would never call me on my birthday. So, one day, I called long-distance and said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry I just called out of the blue. I can\u2019t remember when your birthday is so I didn\u2019t call on the last day of March or the first day of April. It\u2019s October 19th, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you remembered.\u201d\n\nHe would, too.\n\nAnd, he did.\n\nShe always sent me pictures of her and Dad. She would have been sixty three last year. He died exactly one year to the day.\n\nOn her birthday every year, she would put out two bowls of M&Ms and a slice of peanut butter pie for everyone to share. They liked pie. Mom didn\u2019t care if they liked it or not, but she liked making it because she always made sure I ate some right away\u2014even if I was eating a salad. Whenever she did that, she would also say, that pie is a gift. So I had to eat at least one for her birthday every year. It\u2019s a simple, but precious, gift, she said. It can mean a lot to someone.\n\nWhen Dad died, she didn\u2019t put out pie.\n\nBut she did put out cookies that she had made. That year I came to New York.

{"text": "we analyze the optical counterpart to the ultra - compact (UC) X-ray binary (XRB) V4641 Sgr using archival Chandra and Hubble observations. The optical counterpart is bright and blue, with a spectrum strongly constraining its nature as an O8-9 main-sequence star. Our light curve implies a superhump period of 3.95 hours, nearly one-third of the 3.91-hour X-ray period proposed by @Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007. We also present spectral line evidence for a wind in the optical spectrum that is very slow and unusually broad for O-stars, probably caused by the strong FeII emission. Because of its low luminosity and rapid rotation ($v$ sin $i$ = 450 kms$^{-1}$), the putative companion is not orbiting the supergiant, but instead is a binary companion in a wide, mildly eccentric orbit. A fit of the radial velocity orbit to our UV spectra suggests an inclination angle of $60^{\\circ}$, making the companion orbit inclined with respect to the massive stellar surface.\n\nObservations\n============\n\nThe data were obtained from two sources. The optical and ultraviolet (UV) images and ground-based optical spectra were acquired by the X-Ray Monitoring System (XMS) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. UV spectra through the F22T\\_AOR and F15R\\_AOR were obtained with the STIS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope [@Gilliland+2003]. The data presented in table \\[tab:stis\\] were obtained from observations taken with the E230M grating with the E230 (low dispersion) or the STIS E140M (medium dispersion) echelle configurations, and the E230M + E140M and STIS echelle modes provide the same spectral coverage with resolutions $R \\approx 7,000$ in the optical and $R \\approx 9,000$ in the UV. Our analysis of the optical spectra and XMS images is described in detail by @van-Zyl2004 and @van-Zyl2005.\n\nX-ray and UV observations were performed in the year 2004, and were obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) as part of regular monitoring of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) for outburst signatures. The data were analyzed using version 12.0.1 of [ Ciao](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/) with standard filtering. The data for V4641 Sgr were obtained in Cycle 17, starting UT August 2, 2005; they represent typical CCD readout streak, and do not have any significant pileup. The data for XTE J1118+480 were processed in Cycle 18, starting September 2006; this data set has the worst ACIS CCD streak and contains noticeable pileup.\n\nThe X-ray light curve\n---------------------\n\nThere are two observations of V4641 Sgr in our archive. The first was obtained on 2000 Aug 5, with ACIS-S for an exposure of 0.7 hr, and the second was obtained on 2002 Aug 4, with ACIS-I for a longer exposure of 5.3 hr. The X-ray light curve reveals two features, shown in detail in Figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\]. One of these, a long, bright outburst that began on August 2, 2005, was described in detail by @Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007. This light curve, along with the X-ray spectral analysis of the data obtained during the outburst, shows that the optical counterpart to this system is an unusual O-star with a large amount of circumstellar matter that, when viewed in the UV, is thought to originate in a slow stellar wind. The other X-ray observation, obtained on 2004 Aug 5, does not confirm that this star is in outburst, despite the high X-ray detection rate of the optical counterpart (Figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\], left panel).\n\nThe outburst observed in 2001 [@Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007; @Garnavich+Chen+2000] was observed in one observation only, and that was obtained by @Smith+Dieters2005 using HST ACS for a long exposure of 5.1 hr. That observation consisted of one single pointing with the ACS/WFC and CCDs F450W and F814W, and is shown in figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\].

An epidemiological survey for DF prevalence was performed on 1180 hospitalized patients with diabetic foot from September 2010 to December 2011. Among these patients, 381 patients (33.2%) developed a DF, and 121 patients (9.9%) reported a nonhealing foot ulcer. The median age was 63.9 \u00b1 10.9 years and the male/female ratio was 0.9. The duration of diabetes was 15.1 \u00b1 10.3 years. The majority of the subjects were being treated with insulin (70.5%) and the average foot ulcer duration was 15.3 \u00b1 13.2 days. The overall prevalence of DF was 33.2% (381 of 1180 patients). The ulcers were mainly type III (63%), IV.A. or IV.B. (61.8%), type II (37%), type IV.A. or IV.B. (35.4%), grade IV.A. or IV.B. (30.6%), and grade III (8.7%).

The incidence and prevalence rates in patients who were administered a specific wound dressing and were treated with an appropriate medication after admission showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.05). This study confirms the high prevalence rate of DF in patients with Type 2 diabetes, with a high incidence and prevalence rate in those with non-healing DF.

{"text": "backgroundfamilial mediterranean fever ( fmf ) is an autosomal recessive systemic disease. It appears mainly in childhood and adolescence but can occur at all ages. This disease is also known as Mediterranean fever ( Mf ), Behan's disease, Behcet's disease and the disease of the Dutch children and is characterized by symptoms with long-lasting remissions and exacerbations. Its first description was in a letter written by a Greek physician in 1891. In 1937, Behcet described the disease in a Turkish patient living in Jiddah, who was a descendant from the Middle East; this patient was later diagnosed as fmf in Iran. As many as 200 cases and 300,000 patients are reported in the literature. The frequency of fmf in different parts of the world differs from its highest incidence rate in the Middle East and in other countries in the Mediterranean. This disease has worldwide geographic distribution in the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, and North Africa. As the primary lesions of fmf occur in the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract and the eyes, the diagnosis of the disease is based mainly on clinical findings. However, some imaging findings, which can be very helpful in its differential diagnosis, help increase the diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic measures used for the diagnosis of fmf are: 1) clinical findings (duration of febrile episodes, joint involvement, eye involvement and orogenital ulcers, and abdominal pain) and their associations; 2) familial or personal histories of fmf; 3) physical examination and findings of systemic involvement; 4) examination of tissue biopsies; and 5) laboratory investigations including serologic analysis, immunoglobulin levels, urinalysis, serum electrophoresis, and culture of blood and urine. We present five patients diagnosed with fmf, who were followed for various periods and also follow-up and control radiologic and sonographic findings. Patients 1-3 were a family group and had a diagnosis of fmf for 15 years. Patients 4 and 5 were the probands of the family and had a history of fmf-like disorders since childhood. We performed imaging, serologic, and genetic studies and confirmed their diagnoses.\n\nIt is a relatively common disease in childhood, but in the first decade there are no differences with Crohn's disease. The symptoms start with abdominal pain, diarrhea and the child may also have rectal bleeding. In the second decade, pain may be more present in the back, or pain in the extremities, and the diarrhea may be more severe. At the end of the third decade, pain, diarrhea and fever may decrease and abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom. In the fourth decade of life, some cases may present with acute pancolitis.\n\nIt is a relatively common disease in childhood, but in the first decade there are no differences with Crohn's disease.

Argentina has about 50 million inhabitants and half of them use the Public Health System, whereas the other half are covered by private insurance, which has been considered by the government to be inefficient, and it has not shown that the poor are better served. In 1996, the Ministry of Health created the Paramedical Service and at that time, about 1 million patients were attending the Medical Units and the rest of the services were to be created in the future. The goal was the development and dissemination of the knowledge of the disease and a health system that was as safe as possible by the development and implementation of educational programs, guidelines and protocols, and by a health system that is effective, accessible and of high quality, which ensures the population's health. At the same time, patients would be able to see specialists and would be able to refer themselves and would pay for their care, following a system where the poor would not lose their access to health care services. The main objective has been achieved. There are four areas or services: the preventive area, the prenatal area, the medical area and the administrative services.\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the predictors of the outcome (failure and success) in our series of patients. We examined the relationship between endoscopic success, radiographic success and the etiology of the aneurysms, including bile duct lithiasis and the spasm. The secondary objectives included evaluating the factors that may have an effect on surgery, including the etiology and the level of jaundice and the intraoperative", "label": 1, "id": 100452}
{"text": "For those out there that like to think of themselves as political junk-o-jargon junkies, there is a certain degree to which every piece of news is an object for contemplation.\n\nWhen Obama took office, in the wake of the 2008-2009 Bush Recession, the question was: Will this continue, or will the recovery take hold?\n\nWill the public begin to believe in the economic recovery? Or will it be the start of a new era of austerity and slow growth?\n\nWhere will the Democratic Party come back from?\n\nWill the U.S. remain a superpower? Or be relegated to second-tier globalist status, with American power on the wane?\n\nObama had to show that he had something to do with the improving economy; that he had turned things around.\n\nHe had to be, essentially, all things to all men. All the while, people were wondering: How will he respond to a challenge?\n\nObama was still considered the weakest of the Obama administration's presidential contenders.\n\nIn the first years of his administration, Obama responded to events by adopting very passive methods.\n\nAt first, Obama was content to play defense, the way his campaign played defense in debates.\n\nHe was defensive before the November elections.\n\nObama was passive because of bad poll-reading or an unwillingness to challenge the polls.\n\nHe didn't have strong poll ratings of his own, but the polls were generally predicting Democratic victory.\n\nBarack Obama had only recently been elected president. Yet, he had to deal with the consequences of decades of neglect. He had to show he was capable of managing. He had to demonstrate he could lead, or the American people would no longer look to him.\n\nThe first few years of Barack Obama's first term were about managing and managing. The economy had to be fixed and managed. And so, Obama's first term was about managing the economy. He had to manage the housing bubble; he had little choice but to manage it. He had to manage the economy to prove his value; he couldn't afford to just let the economy fail.\n\nPresident Obama's policies are not so much those of a \"moderate Republican\" as he has been accused of being by many conservative Republicans themselves, but Obama's policies and his politics have moved the leftward-and-center position.\n\nObama and Rahm Emanuel are so far to the left of \"moderate\" Democrat that they are, by extension, to the left of the far-left. This is evident in Obamacare, in Obama's political decisions, and in Obama's political agenda that has moved the country far to the left in many ways.\n\nThe Obamacare disaster has not been managed by the White House. With Obamacare failing on a daily basis, Obama has resorted to what can only be described as appeasement. Obama is trying to appease his supporters before his election in 2012, and that must be the only explanation for Obama's appeasement of Democrats and liberals.\n\nHe will likely be defeated in the presidential elections -- or else he will probably retire early.\n\nBut the appeasement of Liberal Democrats and Leftist liberals has, so far, succeeded. Obamacare has been given a face-lift. And Obama has proven to his enemies that he is a political man. Obama has made his enemies nervous, but they still don't know what to worry about, or to fear, about the election of 2012. Obama has earned the right to be reelected.\n\nObama's failure to manage the nation has cost him political capital, and now he must try to fix America's problems at a time when the American populace is becoming restive.\n\nThe economic situation and the U.S. economy is not improving in the way the Obama administration would like, however. Obama's reelection will depend on his ability to manage that economy.\n\nIt's the economy, stupid. The American people are beginning to get restless with all the bureacratic stagnation, political intrigue, and waste of taxpayer money at the Treasury Department (which was to be a source of income, once Obamacare and the rest of his agenda was finalized).\n\nThe public is beginning to get restive about the slow pace with which Obama is trying to implement the changes he promised during the campaign. The White House is already facing a possible revolution.\n\nThe White House staff will likely attempt to quell the revolution by managing the economy by managing unemployment. The White House's hope is that by manipulating unemployment rates, Obama can create an environment in which Democrats can be reelected in a few years.\n\nObama will also be tempted to use a tax increase as a justification to raise taxes on the affluent and on the wealthy to provide new revenue to the government. Obama will likely increase taxes on the wealthy just as he increased taxes on the poor during the time he was in Michigan campaigning for the presidency.\n\nAs long as the economy", "label": 1, "id": 100453}
{"text": "we analyzed the oct features of 24 eyes of 12 OHT patients by OCT. They found that OCT parameters of the inner segment ellipsoid, outer segment ellipsoid, photoreceptor layer, and retinal nerve fiber layer displayed significantly lower values in the OHT than in the control group. In addition, the mean inner segment height and mean photoreceptor layer thickness on OCT significantly decreased according to the OHT grades. The OCT studies by Ritari et al.[@B17] confirmed their earlier finding of photoreceptor thinning, and revealed a progressive deterioration of photoreceptor layer morphology with increase in severity of the OHT. However, it also suggests that the macular layer may be spared in OHT as long as the thickness of RPE remains within normal limits. A significant decline in RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex, ganglion cell complex, and choroidal thickness in the inner and outer sectors of OHT was noticed. They also suggested that reduction of RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex thickness is an early indicator of RPE loss; ganglion cell complex thinning is due to damage to the optic nerve, or both. These findings could also be due to edema of optic nerve head, or both. Ritari and colleagues[@B18] found that OHT subjects with visual field loss had thinner retinal and photoreceptor layers than those without visual field defect. There was no difference in RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex thickness between both groups, though. The above OCT findings are almost similar to the structural findings of the current study.\n\nThe optic nerve structure has been studied by our group by using 3-dimensional-OCT in a non-glaucomatous optic nerve study, the results of which are consistent[@B13]. We found that OCT scan reveals a higher resolution and reproducible optic nerve head morphology. This high level of resolution provides us the possibility to perform further analysis of the normal and glaucomatous OHT in a more detailed manner. The 3-dimensional-OCT reveals a greater change in morphology. It gives a view of the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, optic nerve head volume, the peripapillary choroidal volume, the thickness of nerve fibers connecting retina and optic nerve head, and the nerve fiber bundle length. The nerve fiber bundles are the largest nerve endings and connect the retina to optic nerve head and also give the nerve impulse. In glaucoma, the axons lose their strength and die rapidly causing a decrease in nerve fiber bundles. The thinner the nerve fiber bundles, the faster the nerve cell death. Our study has shown a decreased peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal volume and thickness in glaucoma. The peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal thickness were significantly thinner in the OHT eyes than normal controls in our study. This is contrary to the earlier findings[@B14][@B18][@B19][@B20] which showed no thickness differences in the OHT. However, it is consistent with the findings of the OCT studies by Joo, et al.[@B13] that show a decrease in the peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal volume and thickness in glaucoma. Although there are no prior studies done on the 3-dimensional-OCT and OHT, we think our study is unique as we use the 3-dimensional-OCT which gives one more dimension than the conventional 2-dimensional-OCT. The 3-dimensional-OCT has the capability to provide the quantitative data of nerve fiber bundle in OHT which may prove to be helpful in further understanding the OHT mechanism.\n\nOur study\\'s limitations are the relatively small number of patients in the OHT study group and the absence of the normal OHT group, despite the fact that the study population is well characterized and followed up in all patients. We used both 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography and Heidelberg Spectral-domain and conventional optical coherence tomography. There is some difference that may be noted in these OCT devices like the different retinal layer thicknesses in choroidal layers, and different scan patterns of various OCT machines, which also influence the measurements of the choroid and optic nerve. However, both devices were performed by the same examiner with good reproducibility[@B13].\n\nThis is one of the first reports using the 3-dimensional-OCT to study the volume of inner, outer retinal structure, and optic nerve head choroidal layer thicknesses and to determine the presence of nerve fiber bundle defect in OHT. We think that our findings have shown the potential value of the 3-dimensional-OCT for the earlier detection of RGC loss and structural changes in various optic nerve disorders", "label": 1, "id": 100454}

{"text": "In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was possibly the first person to invent the first double decker bus. Diocles had already discovered this new type of engine, when he was in charge of transporting goods on roads, where for the ancient Greeks the most important form of transportation was the chariot.\n\nDiocles made an engine, with two parts; the first was half-open, and the second half was fully closed, like a chest. At the beginning of the engine, the opening in the first part was closed by a wedge, while the second part opened up from the first part to take the first fuel, and when the wedge was released, the opening in the first part came completely closed, and only the second opened.\n\nThe first closed part contained a small chamber, which acted as a \u2018bellows\u2019. The bellows was then ignited by a spark from a taper. However, the bellows also provided energy, that pushed the wedge which locked the first part and provided force that was transmitted to the crank shaft driving the piston.\n\nAn illustration of Diocles. His device is shown in the very first and most famous of \u201cdouble decker\u201d buses from Athens. In this very first double decker, the engine was used to pull a cart along a set of rails.\n\nDiocles invented the \u201cmotor\u201d to take advantage of the same bellows principle described above, and the device was used to build the first double decker buses from the Ancient City of Athens.\n\nThe double decker buses allowed the driver to stop at the back of the bus, when passengers wanted to buy goods, and in this way they used the second part to make a connection point. That is why they were also called \u201cpedes\u201d, which was meaning a wheel.\n\nThere were many different types of double-decker buses.\n\nDiocles of Carystus\n\nDiocles of Carystus made many important inventions. Besides his \u201cmotor\u201d he also built tanks of different sizes, and invented the \u201chydraulic machine\u201d, where two systems of pistons work together with oil and oil is fed from one to the other.\n\nThe cylinder on top of the \u201chydraulic machine\u201d was of a single or double action depending of what it was for, and inside the hydraulic machine there was a valve. This valve was actuated by a screw that moved when pressure was transferred in it.\n\nDiocles of Carystus built a large number of large and small tanks. There is still a tank built by Diocles in Athens in today\u2019s Museum of Archeology. This tank\u2019s original capacity was 20 men.\n\nThe last name of the inventor Diocles of Carystus.

That is when Roberts needed two ways of delivering coal to the engines of his trams, and he wanted to find a reliable system.\n\nHe invented a double-decker coal trolley, and for that purpose he invented an innovative hydraulic pump (hydraulic machinery). The hydraulic pump was made out of cast-iron and was the most advanced example of his inventions at the time. It is a kind of two-stroke engine that provided motive power to his trams.\n\nThe hydraulic pump of Charles Roberts was a double-decker device.\n\nThe double-decker hydraulic pump of Charles Roberts.\n\nThe hydraulic machine (of type T15, built in the \u201cRailway Institute\u201d in 1874) of the invention of Charles Roberts, which ran the first double-decker steam tram in London, England.\n\nThe original image has a number on it.

The addition of antegrade selective\ncerebral perfusion to hypothermic circulatory arrest did not affect the\nshort-term outcomes, neither did it cause more neurological\ndisabilities.\n\nhypothermic circulatory arrest for adult aortic arch repair is still\nlimited.\n\nwe aim to elucidate the short- and long-term outcomes of hypothermic\ncirculatory arrest in adults undergoing adult aortic arch repair with or\nwithout antegrade selective cerebral perfusion.\n\nIn the literature, preoperative risk factors, the incidence of\nneurological complications after hypothermic circulatory arrest, and the\nsafety of its use in supra-aortic-anastomosis has been reported.1- 5\nAdult aortic arch repair requires temporary occlusion of the origin of\nthe ascending aorta, during which the brain is cooled in profound\nhypothermia (20 \u00a1C), followed by reperfusion which causes a sharp raise in\ntemperature (33 \u00a1C) and, then, circulatory arrest. During circulatory\narrest, no blood flow is allowed into the brain, and cerebral blood flow\nis achieved by the collateral circulation.5 However,\nhypothermic circulatory arrest for aortic arch repair has traditionally\ninvolve profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest, limiting its clinical\nimpetus.\n\nThe benefits on the use of this technique have never been\nquantified since the majority of cases are sporadic or in the context of\nresearch protocols. In previous studies, hypothermic circulatory arrest,\nor circulatory arrest with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, was\nused, but the proportion of each technique was quite different. For\ninstance, in 1993 Koyanagi et al.6 reported 8 cases of aortic\narch repair using profound hypothermic circulatory arrest, while, in 1994,\nWise et al.7 reported 6 cases of aortic arch repair using circulatory\narrest with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, to a total of 13\npatients operated on using hypothermia and circulatory arrest (figure\n1). The use of these two techniques changed over the years and, in 2010,\nonly one case of adult aortic arch repair with hypothermic circulatory\narrest was reported.8 However, nowadays,\nthe main concern regarding this technique is the increased rate of\nneurological complications, which are associated with a reduction of the\ndegree of brain protection.5\n\nfigure 1\n\nThe number of aortic arch repair using profound hypothermic\ncirculatory arrest according to authors.\n\nOn the other hand, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion\nmeans circulation arrest, in this case combined with selective\ncirculation to the brain.

We laughed, and at times we would both feel a bit like we were standing in front of the Fuhrer, or I guess Hitler should be called, and the events of that time. I would have liked to see more interaction between Hitler and his associates. I think the makers of this movie had their heart in the right place. This story really touched my heart, because this was what the early Germans of that day would have gone through. They would have been forced to make their first choice. Hitler's personality has always interested me. I read a book about the man and what drives him and how he gets himself into fights and I just wondered what made him different from others. I wondered what made him make that first choice. He did not seem to be like any other human, because that first step he made and then followed up was something that seemed to be foreign to others. It seems that his mother influenced him a great deal before he was born and after he was born.\n\nHitler (or more precisely Fritz) as he was called, was born on 20th April, 1889, in Graz, Austria. His father Alois was a farmer, and his mother, Klara, was a waitress in a butcher shop in Graz. Alois died in 1899 and Klara then took in Fritz and brought him up. Fritz attended school in Graz until the age of 11, because his mother had to work and Fritz had to work with his father as well. In 1905, she gave her son the nickname Adolf, because the boy was always called Fritz after two years of being with his mother.\n\n1910 Adolph Hitler joins the Austrian National Socialist party and he is not impressed with it. He doesn't agree with the way the party acts and the way they have their meetings. One day in his opinion, the party did nothing for the country, and didn't even work in favor of the workers and poor people. Although most people in Nazi Germany hated the Nazi party, Hitler was one of his followers. He was told that most of his friends and classmates disliked the Nazis, but in 1912 he becomes leader of the Young Socialists - a branch of the Nazi party. His friends tell him not to become leader, and Hitler takes their advice.\n\nIn the year 1914 the great war between Germany and Austria breaks out, and in September, Fritz's father dies. He was a very good man and he was proud of his son Fritz. Hitler decided to go to Vienna and try to make his mark in the war. His first chance was in August, 1916, when the Russians sent 15,000 men to the Austrians. These men outnumbered the Austrians, and the Austrians gave way and fled.\n\nBefore the great powers at Versailles, all of the territories were carved up according to the wishes of the victor. The Austrians had been defeated, but they still had to accept the agreement of their neighbor, Romania to make it easier for this neighbor to take the land of the Ukrainians, including the territory which is now Romania. The whole thing took a lot longer than anyone was prepared for. The Austrian economy was still in a state of recovery, but a lot of Austrians had joined the Austro-Hungarian army. This army was never considered anything exceptional, and it was not considered special at Versailles either. Fritz saw nothing wrong with it, and neither did Hitler.\n\nThe main part of this great war on the continent, however, involved Germany. Fritz's job was to lead his troops across the Danube River in the south of Austria to fight the people he disliked, but it didn't take him long to feel that it was for the best and for the country itself. Austria lost the war, and the Austrians were forced to cede land to the Germans. The country's government had to agree to this.\n\nThis war was a great loss for Austria. It had lost a great amount of land and resources, and it lost a lot of people, so it was one of the poorest countries remaining in the world. Fritz himself did not go", "label": 1, "id": 100461}
{"text": "standard order - disorder phase transition in the ising model\n\nFirst, we review the phase transition observed in some simple lattice models [@Lee]. The Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>}S_i S_j + h\\sum_i S_i\\end{aligned}$$ where $J > 0$ is coupling constant and $h$ is external bias field. A local field $f_i=-S_j$ is applied to one site $i$ in the system. The model with $J>0.5h$ (antiferromagnetic model) undergoes a first order transition, between two phases \u2013 ordered and disordered. But if $J<0.5h$ (ferromagnetic model) the system shows no transition. That means the disorder phase transition is missing.\n\nWe would like to apply this model to study disorder induced first order transition of Ising model on a disordered cubic lattice. Ising model on such a lattice shows a continuous disorder induced phase transition [@FisherPRB1984]. But this model suffers from a critical slowing down, which prevents the system to equilibrate [@LubchenkoNatPhy2005]. Another interesting model is the $2d$ $q=8$ Potts model. Unlike the Ising model it has more than one critical temperature. On a square lattice, at low temperature, there is a transition from anti-ferromagnetically ordered, disordered phase and at higher temperature (which is the same as for the Ising model) there is a thermal transition from ferromagnetically ordered, disordered phase. [@WuPRL2005; @WuSciRep2011]. We would like to have a new model, exhibiting the disorder induced first order phase transition.\n\nNow, we introduce a disordered Ising model on triangular and square lattices. On triangular lattice, the Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>^\\ast-r\\delta_i}S_iS_j+h\\sum_i S_i \\end{aligned}$$ where $J=J^\\ast+d_0S_z^2$ (we have introduced a small perturbation proportional to $d_0$ to overcome the critical slowing down problem) and $\\delta_i$ represents the nearest and next-nearest neighbor. $S_z$ is the spin in $z$ axis. $r$ represents coordination number, defined as $r=2$ (each site have four nearest neighbors: 2, 2 and 1, 1). On a square lattice the Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>^\\ast}S_iS_j+h\\sum_i S_i+K\\sum_{ij}Z_0(r_{ij})\\end{aligned}$$ $Z_0(r)$ represents the disordered structure factor $$\\begin{aligned}\nZ_0(r)=2\\{(1-\\cos(\\theta))+\\cos r\\}\\end{aligned}$$ $r=r_{ij}$ is distance between the nearest neighbors and the lattice point $i$ and $j$ are fixed in this model (we do not have any dynamic disorder in lattice model). On a square lattice we have: $$\\begin{aligned}\nZ_0(r)=2(1-(1+\\cos r/2)^2)\\end{aligned}$$ where the nearest-neighbor distances are $2$ and $3$ in triangular and cubic lattices, respectively.\n\nWe take periodic boundary condition. To determine the nature of the phase transition, we vary both $J$ and $h$ and determine the system magnetization (in a linear-log plot), as in other lattice models, at critical temperatures in different situations. We also perform energy histogram method for further confirmation. When $J=0$, $h=0$, we choose all the spins anti-parallel as \u2018-1\u2019 (ferromagnetic). All other spins are parallel to each other, i.e., in a \u2018+1\u2019 configuration (anti-ferromagnetic). The system starts off as disordered phase. As an external field $h$ is applied gradually, we notice that for sufficiently small $h$, the magnetization abruptly changes from one value to the other, but does not go smoothly (continuously) between them. If $h=0$, the system is completely anti-ferromagnetic, while $h>0.0$ favors one of the spin directions. As \u2018h\u2019 is increased from 0.1", "label": 1, "id": 100462}

That means there's now an opening to compete in the smartphone market in India.\n\nAt the GigaOM Global Summit New Delhi, OnePlus co-founder and CEO Pete Lau had a bit of a dig at Samsung, but did admit that the South Korean company did one thing right. Lau said, \"Samsung is just too large and you cannot compete with them from a size perspective. One of the one thing that we will learn from them is you have to be the size that you are comfortable. You should work on your comfort level.\"\n\nThe company also talked about the importance of expanding its footprint in the market in India and the need to attract new customers across all age groups. \"Our objective is to become a $5-billion company in the next five years,\" Lau said.\n\nOnePlus has announced the OnePlus 4T, which will use the same 6.41-inch AMOLED Infinity display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset as the OnePlus 5, but with a smaller battery at 3,030mAh. Unfortunately, there are no images of the OnePlus 4T available on the device's website, but Lau says it can be expected to get a dual front-facing speaker and OnePlus' gradient finish. Other highlights include an updated front-facing camera with improved selfies and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Lau did mention that the OnePlus 5T is on its way with a bigger battery, but didn't have anything substantial to reveal.\n\nIt seems like there are two main camps of user when it comes to the OnePlus 5. On the one hand, you have those that have to live with it and will be sticking with an outdated OnePlus phone no matter what. The OnePlus 5 has been on Android for several weeks now and so, for a device of that level, the lack of new Android features is a problem. On the other hand, users are using it as their daily driver and as an upgraded product from OnePlus' previous models. For us here at ZdNet, we fall into the latter category given that our OnePlus 3 was our day-to-day device.\n\nOnePlus founder and CEO Pete Lau recently told ZDNet that the OnePlus 5 is the best phone on the market with \"the best hardware you've ever seen, the best software you've ever seen\". The OnePlus 5 even comes with \"all-new hardware improvements and the best software, the best software you've ever seen\" - he says this while showing off a new model of the phone called the OnePlus 5T.\n\nIs it worth getting the OnePlus 5T over the regular model? Lau said: \"If you are just looking for the better camera, definitely get the OnePlus 5T. You won't be disappointed.\"\n\nThe OnePlus 3 is going to get an Android Nougat update in the first quarter of next year, even as its successor, the 5, is about to be launched. The software upgrade comes as the company announced that it has set up an Android Beta group where beta testers from around the world are invited to submit their ideas to the product team. Lau said, \"We are putting the entire software behind a beta for you guys to check out and share any feedback...\n\nIn all of its four years in the market, OnePlus has always been a fan of Android. While the company was at the launch of Moto G5 and M5, Peter and his team were working on the OnePlus 5, which was officially announced as early as May.

Heinlein, but from the moment I saw these characters standing in front of an unknown building, I knew exactly who they were and what had happened, so I had the movie on in the background while I worked on some writing.\n\nThe movie tells the story of four friends who are in the city for a scientific conference. A storm is brewing and one of four men is chosen to enter that building to get vital samples.\n\nThe audience knows something that the characters in the movie do not. Each of the men are aware of the danger of some unknown force that stalks the city. The audience knows, the characters do not. The building stands where the men entered and it has not moved since they disappeared.\n\nI have watched a lot of horror movies to give this review a point of view, and when a man disappears into nothingness, it really is a scary thing. I wouldn't want to be in the position of any of the characters and I certainly wouldn't be looking back for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe movie uses a few devices that are well known in movies. There is a mysterious stranger who is being watched by the characters. There is an appearance of someone who has died long ago on the screen. The movie really tries to be scary and the results are chilling.\n\nThe music is very fitting for the different scenes. It is appropriate music for a scientific story and very effective in making the audience wonder what this new threat will do next.\nThe cast, which is excellent, knows their parts extremely well and all the members have a distinct personality - no one plays a character better than the actor portrays the character.\nThe movie won the \"Best Horror\" at the 2016 San Diego International Film Festival.

{"text": "Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a nonradioactive and chemically inert diatomic gas that is essential to all aerobic organisms. It reacts violently with certain metals, most notably iron, and hence a red color is observed with the naked eye when oxygen is present in iron as a result of the formation of the iron oxide (rust) or rust. However, the same metal, when immersed in water and ignited, gives off a bright blueish-white flame known as corona discharge. The metal iron also has a unique property wherein when it is placed in pure water and struck the water produces sound at 1,000 hz. It is this unique property of iron that has led to its widespread use in the manufacture of the ubiquitous steel and iron-based alloys.\n\nIron and steel are essential building materials of modern society. These two materials together comprise the base of the economy. The global annual production in 2010 was estimated as about 5 billion metric tons. About 90% of this production is used for manufacturing of steel products. The remaining 10% is used for other metal products like iron, bronze, copper, aluminum, aluminum alloys, zinc, magnesium etc.\\[[@CIT1]\\]\n\nIron is an excellent high-strength material and finds application in many industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace and marine.\\[[@CIT2][@CIT3]\\] It has numerous application in medicine as a magnetic material used in MRI. It is also used in the manufacturing of high-strength alloys (A36) that are being used in the manufacture of lightweight racing bicycles.\\[[@CIT1]\\] About 80% of iron on the planet is used in the manufacture of steel. There are several high-strength steel grades for which demand exceeds production and this situation is even getting worse. One such grade is A-50 of the ASTM standard alloy (A36) for which demand is about 30% of total global production. The main markets for this grade of steel are those industries which require high-strength, high-alloy and highly corrosion resistant materials for construction such as bridges, high-rise buildings and naval applications.\\[[@CIT4][@CIT5]\\] In the case of naval applications, the A-50 steel comprises the basic high-strength platform for new nuclear marine vessels. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) has stated that the new American nuclear-powered submarines should be built of this type of material.\\[[@CIT6]\\] However, the demand of the stainless grade from the domestic industry is about 400,000 tons per year. The major challenge for the sector in recent years is to increase the domestic production of such high-strength material.\n\nThere has been considerable research in recent times aimed at improving the properties of iron in order to meet the changing economic demands of the steel industry. New steel grades with improved machinability, corrosion resistance and weldablility have been developed. The new grades of steel have come up with several advantages in comparison with the older grades.\\[[@CIT6][@CIT7]\\] To cite a few of the advances over the past few years, the corrosion resistance has been enhanced in steels by the addition of nickel and molybdenum, hence the name NiMo; higher carbon steel grades with improved grain size by the addition of silicon; improved machinability and toughness of stainless steel by addition of chromium for instance stainless type 304 steel, for which the austenitic and ferritic grades are the major ones; improvements in machinability by the addition of aluminum to increase thermal conductivity, which helps in better heat-treat; and improved structural performance by addition of tungsten in steel grades (A, X and P) that are commonly used in aircraft, automobiles and oil industry.\n\nThere are several methods of metallurgical control for improving the properties of steel; the following are the various approaches being followed by researchers, suppliers or industries to control the properties of steel.\n\nIn the case of the grade A-50 steel, there has been considerable research on the following parameters. Since the grade has an ultra-low carbon content, it is very brittle. As a countermeasure, the ductility and toughness has been enhanced through the addition of several elements like nickel, molybdenum, chromium or tungsten in the steel. There are several other methods such as casting with alloying additions, welding, heat treatment and rolling etc. which have been used to enhance strength of A-50 grade steel. It is the most widely used material for the manufacture of steel products like heavy duty machineries, power transmission gears, pumps, marine applications, railway axle standards, marine propulsion systems, nuclear applications etc.\n\nIn another approach of controlling the properties of steel, metallization of the steel has found wide application in the past few years since it has been", "label": 1, "id": 100465}

The main theorem in Section \\[s4\\] states that ${B(T, R)}\\setminus \\mathring{B(T, R)}_0$ has the same topological property with the one in [@F], which implies that K\u00e4hler angles of $B(T, R)\\setminus \\mathring{B(T, R)}_0$ are constant.

In Section \\[s6\\], we use $D_{X\\times X}$ to denote the diagonal embedding $X\\rightarrow X\\times X$. It is an interesting problem to understand the image of the projection $M_P\\setminus\\mathring{B(T, R)}_0\\rightarrow M_P$. At least, one knows the image contains some \u201chorizontal\" divisor, which does not seem to be the diagonal embedding.\n\nK\u00e4hler angle of a toric surface {#s1}\n===============================\n\nWe shall begin with the toric surfaces. First of all, it is well known that a compact K\u00e4hler surface $S$ is a toric surface except 0-dimentional ones(Example \\[exm1\\]). Let $M_S=\\mathbb{Z}^2$ be the lattice of one-cycles. The corresponding lattice can also be obtained by taking the primitive generating vectors of the ray generators of a maximal cone $\\sigma$ in a fan associated with $S$(in toric case, it is the one-skeleton of a fan in $N$). We denote $U=(-1, -1)$, $V=(-1, 1), ~W= (-1, 1)$ the primitive lattice vectors. Let $u_S$ be the corresponding class in $H^{1,1}$, then $(1, 1)= u_S^{\\vee} + u_S$. For any toric surface with fan $\\mathcal{S}$, the following equation holds in Equation $(\\star)$, $$\\label{kahlerangle}\n \\tan\\beta = \\frac{|N_S| \\frac{1}{u_S} }{ |G_S| \\frac{1}{u_S^{\\vee}}}.$$ where $\\beta$ is the K\u00e4hler angle of $S$, and $|N_S|, |G_S|$ represent the area(resp. number of edges) of $\\sigma$ and the fundamental group(resp. number of faces/gons) of $\\sigma$, $u_S$ is the generator of $\\sigma$, resp. $\\beta$ is the K\u00e4hler angle of $S$, resp. ${\\beta^{\\prime}}$ is the K\u00e4hler angle of $S^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe formula (\\[kahlerangle\\]) is obtained by observing K\u00e4hler angles of toric domains and then it is extended to general surfaces. The computation is complicated: since the equation (\\[kahlerangle\\]) needs both the number of edges and faces/gons, in order to understand the geometric meaning of such a decomposition, one needs to understand how this numbers distribute. To illustrate this point of view, we list two examples from [@O2]. For a complete rational surface $S$(i.e., all the boundary divisors of $S$ are in $G(S)$[^1]), $|F_S|=|B_S|$ for $|E_S|$ boundary divisors.

{"text": "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla, as seen in this image from the Ctenophora Consortium. Ctenophores include all organisms whose body consists chiefly or solely of a large membrane-enclosed cell, and they are the only known animals that exhibit true coelotyes.\n\nThe word \u201cctenophore\u201d comes from an ancient Greek word meaning \u201cone covered in tentacles,\u201d with a capital \u201cC\u201d. Ctenophores can be either animals or plants, with approximately 35 known species of ctenophores from every major body of water on the planet. Ctenophores are often referred to as comb jellies, sea gooseberries, or \u201cbranched jelly fish.\u201d While that description seems accurate, the body shapes are often quite different from the body shapes of jellyfish. For example, many species of ctenophores are soft and thin, and often lack a bell-type rhopalium. They can vary greatly in size from a few millimeters to many meters across, with even the largest known individuals much smaller than a meter across. But like jellyfish, ctenophores are generally soft bodied and lack internal skeletons, although there are a few exceptions (e.g. cydippid ctenophores).\n\nCtenophores are very diverse and have a variety of unusual features, with many species having bizarre anatomy, unusual behavior, or both. Some species live on the ocean bottom, never swimming, and have no mouthpart or feeding apparatus at all. In sharp contrast some species are capable of amazing, rapid, fluid movement and are often highly agile. For example, we can only guess what behavior may allow the small transparent plankton-eating animal known as a pterioctopus to move swiftly across the surface of the sea, with its entire body covered in tentacles.\n\nDespite the obvious challenges in observing ctenophores, there are a great many interesting aspects of these animals, and a great many of those aspects remain unknown. They are an interesting group of organisms that are much like animals and much like plants, yet much more than both \u2014 for example, unlike plants, ctenophores lack chlorophyll and are dependent on symbiotic algae for basic nutrition and energy metabolism. Unlike most animals, they possess no central nervous system and no muscles, yet they can swim rapidly, and exhibit a wide variety of behaviors. The ctenophore Phrynomedusa are reported to respond to physical stimuli and have responses that they are quite aware of having in the past. These features make ctenophores an excellent group for studying how nervous systems work, and understanding how plants work and how plants and animals are related will also benefit.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, the genetic basis of ctenophore development, anatomy, physiology, behavior, sensory organs and other aspects of development have been decoded with significant success. In addition to being a model organism for studying developmental and evolutionary aspects of animal development, ctenophores are of great interest because they are probably the best example yet of a completely separate phylum of metazoan animals, representing another large branch on the evolutionary tree of the Eukaryota. They are also thought to be the sister group to the sponges, an interesting possibility that could have profound implications for understanding the evolution of plants and animals.\n\nIn addition to their developmental, anatomical, and physiological characteristics, ctenophores have very beautiful colors associated with the distribution of two photosynthetic algae associated with each and every ctenophore, an unusual feature that has been shown to have major evolutionary and developmental importance. More recent work is revealing other unusual aspects of ctenophore biology. For example, the recent discovery of large protein clams indicates that ctenophores can make use of very large numbers of large cells of very similar structure to use as a structural part of their bodies. Furthermore, the fact that they have no central nervous system, yet they do exhibit behavior, and the fact that they possess very complex sensory organs, make ctenophores one of the most interesting animals ever studied.\n\nThe most famous (and least understood) ctenophores are the comb jellies, in which there are two large photosynthesizing algae known as photoblasts present at the apex of the tentacles. They are commonly referred to as \u201ccomb jellies\u201d for reasons that will become clear. Comb jellies are often quite transparent and are considered to be a prime example of benthic organisms since they cannot swim long distances, and they are never far away from their food supply \u2014 both of which are characteristics of many comb jellies.\n\nDespite that, little detailed information is currently available about any of the comb jelly species. The lack of detailed knowledge about comb jelly biology derives from their unusual anatomy at the ctenostyle (\u201ccomb\ufffd", "label": 1, "id": 100469}

The simulations also show that there is no preference for a coil-like conformation at high ionic concentrations. A model structure was developed to describe the interaction between two single ion PSS chains. A theoretical approach was used to study the effect of electrostatics on the structure of the PSS model and the theoretical results are compared with the simulations. As no experimental method exists for the measurement of the radius of gyration of the PSS backbone in aqueous solution over a wide range of ionic strengths, the use of theory in such a situation is a valid alternative.

{"text": "introduction : the apert syndrome is a rare disorder of the ectoderm. the incidence is estimated to be 0.005 per 10 000 births. this condition is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy and is characterized by ectodermal defects of the face and skin. this condition may occur later in pregnancy as well. it is believed to be transmitted by means of autosomal recessive inheritance. apert syndrome is also known as acrocephalopolysynostosis. this is a rare congenital cranial deformity characterized by premature fusion of sutures, malformations of the face, and syndactyly. apert syndrome has an autosomal dominant form, as well. apert syndrome is a major cause of perinatal death and is associated with midline defects of the brain, spinal cord, heart and diaphragm. apert syndrome occurs approximately four years earlier than the diastrophic dysplasia type ii.\n\nclinical findings: apert syndrome may present in several ways with a number of signs, depending on the extent of cranial malformation. symptoms include: facial dysmorphism \u2013 small nose, hypertelorism (dilated orbits), low-set, and depressed ears; dysmorphy is also seen in the hands and the extremities; the affected newborn frequently has feeding difficulties. midfacial malformations are not always present and include: hypertelorism, a rounded, depressed, malar, and ocular orbit; a small and narrow nose; a small mouth; thickened, thickened and web-like fingers; joint laxity\n\nsignificance: the main concern with apert syndrome is aortic root dilation. this can compromise the patient\u2019s life expectancy. the condition is progressive and the child may die within two years of delivery.\n\ndiagnosis: apert syndrome should be suspected clinically in any newborn presenting with premature closure of the coronal sutures and the skull. this diagnosis can only be confirmed by genetic testing of the fetus\u2019 blood.\n\ntreatment: the most important aspect of treatment in children with apert syndrome is management of feeding problems and monitoring for growth and development.\n\npaul bennett\n\nbennett\u2019s vital signs\n\ncauses of death in the newborn:\n\nheart failure may be caused by several types of congenital heart disease, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and aortic coarctation. in addition, aortic overgrowth and dilation of the aortic root may lead to heart failure. aortic dissection or aneurysm of the aorta may lead to blood flow away from the brain and heart and into the aorta. death may also be caused by complications of childbirth, such as uterine rupture, shoulder dystocia and cord prolapse causing asphyxia or injury to the newborn.\n\ntreatment of heart failure: infants will usually die either because of respiratory insufficiency or heart failure. the cause of heart failure in patients with apert syndrome was postulated in 1954 by the author of this condition following three postmortem examinations of a group of patients with a broad spectrum of dysmorphic features. it is caused by two or more anomalies of the interventricular septum leading to a restrictive ventricular function. the diagnosis was established by finding dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism with midline fusion of the median part of the skull. apert syndrome should be suspected clinically in any newborn presenting with premature closure of the coronal sutures and the skull. this diagnosis can only be confirmed by genetic testing of the fetus\u2019 blood. apert syndrome should be considered in any child with congenital midline cranial defects and the features of hypertelorism and a low-set, round chin. apert syndrome is associated with a number of conditions that may also be present (meckel syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia, and some forms of brachytelephalangism). brachydactyly, a distinctive feature of this syndrome, is most common in children with a known syndrome.\n\nsignificance: a number of genes involved in signaling and extracellular matrix production have been implicated as causes of apert syndrome. the genes are part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling families. in most of the cases, both alleles of the maternal apert allele are inactive and the disease is the result of the absence of a paternal allele. recessive forms of apert syndrome result from mutations in type II collagen (COL II). both the heterozygous and homozygous recessive conditions of apert syndrome result from loss-of-function mutations of the fibronectin 1 (FN1) gene.\n\nmortality rates for premature infants in the first year of life:", "label": 1, "id": 100473}

{"text": "As is often the case when you attempt to take an old film (in this case the 1936 film) for a spin in high definition, the end result is often, well, interesting, but often messy. As has been the case for past efforts, Dark Knight and The Amazing Spiderman 2 are still going strong, with more movies planned after Batman (this one, The Dark Knight Rises, and the final installment in The Amazing Spiderman franchise, The Amazing Spiderman 3 \u2013 not to be confused with its 2012 reboot). After their respective debut this weekend, we decided to see just how well the films would look in high definition.\n\nBefore I get to the nitty-gritty, let us start off with a discussion of how the new Blu-ray technology has worked out so far. For the casual Blu-ray fan, the results for the first three releases have been somewhat mixed. Both of the films on this year\u2019s Best of 2010 list are excellent presentations from the high-resolution discs, with The Dark Knight looking better than ever before and The Last Airbender coming across as both sharp and detailed. However, while there was a lot of discussion before release about how well Dark Knight would translate, even after this film, it must be noted that the new technology is still not as impressive as it could be. That being said, the visual presentation of Dark Knight Rises is impressive, and the new 3D still holds its own. The other major success story of the technology so far has been The Amazing Spiderman 2, which looked spectacularly good both 2D and 3D, for which it was nominated for Best Film Editing.\n\nSpeaking of 3D, with Batman (and, soon, The Dark Knight Rises), it will be interesting to see how it translates, both in terms of technology and the quality of film. The question is whether or not the film will look significantly better in 3D for an audience, or will it look better to those who own the 3D technology required to watch it? That question answers itself, as Batman could easily translate better to a 3D audience, as it would likely look fantastic if it were to appear on a home television, where 3D films are frequently released, but if it appears on a Blu-ray 3D player, it will appear slightly out of its element.\n\nFor now, there is some speculation that even if one of these films were to appear on 3D television before release, it is unlikely that it might actually look better \u2013 unless a company like Turner Classic Movies, for example, is willing to convert its broadcasts to high resolution. What does this mean for The Dark Knight Rises? Well, as most would agree, it has a bit of a long run between it and release, and by the time it does, the technology will be even more mature. I\u2019ll be curious to see how the new Blu-ray technology holds up when it comes out and how close Dark Knight looks on release.\n\nAt the present, though, we have two fairly spectacular (if not identical) films from two of the year\u2019s big new releases, with one of them looking much better on Blu-ray. Let\u2019s get to them.The Dark Knight\n\nRelease Date: Friday, November 20th\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, and a fan of previous films in the series, I had a lot of expectations heading into this film. After all, the film had to take place in an entirely new era, meaning the characters had to look much different, and as the films\u2019 new director (Chris Nolan) was working with a completely new cast of characters, the opportunity to take a film that was still fresh and reinterpret it in its own way was a great opportunity.\n\nAs someone who hasn\u2019t seen the previous films, most of that is gone at the start, where we see the emergence of one of the main characters, a crimefighter by the name of Batman (Christian Bale), who is trying to find himself outside of Dick Grayson (Michael Cane), his partner and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. This film also shows us Bruce Wayne\u2019s new life as one of Gotham\u2019s wealthiest citizens, and his new place in society, much to the annoyance of Thomas Elliot (Morgan Freeman), who tries to have him return to the world of crimefighting.\n\nAs noted above, the first ten minutes of this film are the most interesting, as the new film jumps ahead nearly ten years, and Batman and his new partner are both a little older and have moved on from the world of crimefighting. The beginning of this film is also the best place to see the evolution of the character of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) \u2013 an extremely complex and sympathetic character, who has a lot of interesting backstory, and is one of the more interesting new characters to come out of this film.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a fairly strong film, and the direction and performances \u2013 both old and", "label": 1, "id": 100475}

While Frank and Judy's friends search on the trail left behind, they eventually find Mrs. Braddock's car, but not Mrs. Braddock; the only thing they find is an ape's footprint. A rescue team led by Lt. Virgil Cole (Cesar Romero) and a tracker come across them.

{"text": "The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. These were Trier, Cologne, Bonn, Mainz, and Worms. The fifth base, Cologne, was established by Julius Caesar, who was given the honor to place the first stone as dedication on his new fortress.\n\nCaesar\u2019s new fortress was the first attempt by the Romans to permanently establish a military fortress on European soil because until that time the Romans always used fortresses to protect themselves against the various indigenous forces. After the Roman army conquered a new territory, they established a new city and fortified it with an army to hold it for the Roman legions. The Romans built more than 150 forts in the Germanic regions of Pannonia, Moesia, and Germania, some of which are still visible today.\n\nThe earliest traces of occupation along the Rhine were found in Lower Germania, in a village called Unver near L\u00fcttfeld, and in a Roman military base at Castel Waldau. After the Romans conquered that area, they found many German tribes, and they were forced to send a garrison to keep guard over them.\n\nThe Roman general and politician Flavius Cornelius Severus, who led the Roman legions in Pannonia, was one of those German who conquered Lower Germania. He defeated the Suebi, a Germanic people north of the Rhine, and he went on to hold several German forts. Many German forts were built after he was promoted to the command of the Fifth legion and the Emperor Trajan made him the new Roman governor of Lower Germany.\n\nThe first forts were built as temporary positions for the Roman armies, but many of them were constructed in a manner that would stand the test of time. Roman forts were designed to survive a long period of time, even during a war between two forces\u2014they were intended to resist a long siege.\n\nThe Romans were very determined not to leave any area they had conquered. That is the reason why they took great care with the construction of Fort VII on the Rhine, which was constructed as a secure stronghold to protect the Roman forces located on the opposite bank. The Rhine was the border between two different regions, so Roman settlements, forts, and military bases were frequently separated into two separate countries as they went up the Rhine river.\n\nFort VII was built between modern day Cologne and Mainz. According to historians, it was the most important Roman base on the Rhine River. Today, the area is called Rheinmose (\u201cRhine mouse\u201d). The Romans kept 10 cohorts in the military base for a long time, more than two centuries. This is a unique and impressive record; this military base was used by the Romans throughout two centuries without the need for any sort of major military operations to keep it standing.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd century, Fort VII was a civilian settlement. The Rhine was the border between Roman and Germanic people. The Romans had conquered this area from some Germanic tribes, but they allowed a certain number of tribes to remain. The Romans used Roman names, like Castellum, for the remaining Germanic villages or towns. Roman names for towns, like Cologne, Mainz, or Worms, were also used.\n\nOver time, the population of people living on either side of the Rhine changed, and some people\u2014of different tribes lived in the two towns. Those who were Germanic people were named after their homeland and used different dialects from those who had moved into the area. This brought the border between the two sides as they traveled further into the Rhine River.\n\nAs the population changed, the government of the Roman Empire also changed. Emperor Domitian ordered the establishment of military bases at the German towns along the Rhine. These military bases were used to keep an eye on the German tribes who were living across the river. At the beginning of the 3rd century, Fort VII was converted into an administrative center or an army encampment, because the Empire felt that the town was at risk of becoming too Germanic. The Emperor made Cologne the capital of the Roman empire and divided some of the Germanic tribes on the Rhine into four different legions and divided their area into four regions.\n\nAfter those four legions were established, they had a better ability to protect the Empire. The Emperor knew that they could no longer use these military bases along the Rhine. It was also necessary to establish another town just for administrative purposes because the Empire was becoming too large, and Fort VII just wasn\u2019t enough to sustain a large military power. In other words, the Empire needed smaller fortresses to govern the local Germanic tribes who were being controlled by the Emperor. Fort VII needed to be divided into smaller structures for the Empire to sustain large scale military control.\n\nThe Emperor decided to split the fort into smaller military bases that would each look after one German", "label": 1, "id": 100477}
{"text": "Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water with a heat source derived from the decay of radioactive material. As is known in the art, the radioactive material is contained in reactor cores or fuel element assemblies of a boiling water reactor. Typically, the cores or assemblies contain approximately equal amounts of a soluble and insoluble fissionable material, such as uranium or plutonium. While the exact ratio can change, it is generally believed to be approximately 3 parts uranium 235, approximately 1 part uranium 238, and approximately 4 parts fission products including some isotopes of xenon, argon, krypton, polonium, bromine, sulfur and iodine. In the reactor, fission of the uranium and plutonium occurs such that the heat source is contained in a large pool of water, or in alternate words, a large volume of liquid water.\nAs the reactor core and fuel element assemblies are used, they are removed from service for refueling. During this process, the fuel element assemblies are transferred to a drywell. In this process, all of the water is drained from the fuel element assemblies or cores, leaving only the depleted fuel cores. However, some of the depleted fuel cores contain water trapped in the structure of the fuel elements in the form of a film that has formed on the surfaces of the fuel pellets, cladding tubes, and spacers between the fuel pellets and/or between the cladding tubes. This is because the core does not remain isolated during the service interval. Rather, some water is absorbed into the fuel pellets, causing them to swell. Furthermore, some water is absorbed into the cladding tubes and spacers. Although the exact reason why this film is established is not completely understood, it is believed that the film is formed as a consequence of an azeotropic dehydration reaction of water from the steam voids surrounding the fuel pellets and the fuel elements. The term \u201csteam voids\u201d is used herein to mean regions where steam has not yet been absorbed by the fuel elements.\nThe film that forms tends to be rather thick, on the order of thousands of microns or more. In order to remove the cladding and the fuel pellets and their cladding with the film left on them, the cladding tubes and fuel pellets are separated from the depleted fuel cores. Therefore the water absorbed into the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets is allowed to evaporate, and the absorbed water is then allowed to separate from the walls of the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets. It should be kept in mind that the water absorbed into the fuel pellets and cladding tubes is already quite concentrated and there is a high solubility for water in many metals, so the film is in the form of a solution of the metal and absorbed water. While it is preferred to remove the water from a single fuel element, it is sometimes necessary to separate the cladding from one or more multiple cladding tube segments and then remove the cladding tubes with the absorbed water left on them from a single fuel element. In order to remove the cladding with water from the fuel pellets and spacer as thoroughly as possible, it is desirable to perform the separation by first rinsing the fuel pellets and spacers that were not originally immersed in the fuel pool of the reactor core using water. Some water may also be injected into the drywell to further remove the absorbed water, although the amount of water necessary for this procedure is not always obvious or predictable.\nWhile some drywashing and other processes for removing the absorbed water from the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets can effectively remove the film to an extent, the film that is left is very adhesive. It tends to bond strongly to other surfaces, such as to the side of the drywell that it is intended to clean. As a result, the film that builds up forms a relatively hard, very adherent bond to other materials.\nAn attempt to remove the film formed between the fuel pellets and the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets and the spacers was attempted using acid cleaning techniques. This is because it is known that many metals, both ferrous and non-ferrous, can be dissolved by using sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid tends to dissolve the cladding tubes, the spacers, and the fuel pellets and their cladding. However, the strong acid is not selective enough. In addition, it is not able to dissolve the absorbed water sufficiently. The acid also destroys or severely degrades the physical and chemical structure of the metal surfaces that it contacts. In essence, acid cleaning removes the cladding tubes, the spacers, and the fuel pellets and their cladding as a whole. It is then sometimes necessary to refabricate some of the components before they can be returned to the reactor core.\nIn order to prevent the film from building up on other surfaces, it has been known to use water jet washing techniques for removing the film. One such technique is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,", "label": 1, "id": 100478}
{"text": "Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the same day that saw me catch up with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the cinema, this movie is one that has always intrigued me. It isn't the story I expected from looking at the artwork, which is perhaps down to the fact that it's been almost 50 years since I first saw it and my memory has faded a bit from the movie. I find it amazing, in fact, that Walt ever approved this movie, which was made way before the days of advanced animatronics and CG. It looks so very, very old-school, yet despite that, it seems to speak to a very early age and time.\n\nThis movie takes place in a place we all think we've been in the movie at some point in time, but there is little evidence to suggest we have ever been there. In this particular movie, when people are walking through the town at night, it's so dark there that all we can see in the way of objects are the forms and shadows of people and objects.\n\nTo the young and innocent audience that was in the cinema, the images on the screen will have been the reality of this night time situation, an environment where little can or does happen and things that are hidden are revealed, including the body of a little girl.\n\nThe night in question, is what was the night that the little girl ran through the streets of a dark and dreary town with the purpose of searching for her friends that had gone out for a walk and were never seen again. The scene is then, set in one of the many towns around this world, where the citizens would have watched, with great concern, as the night turned into day, where it turned into day, where it turned into day, and the little girl never returned. In one of the local towns, there was a young boy from a large family, whose parents had long since departed to another country. With his young sister by his side, he wandered aimlessly around town, thinking about the night but unable to recollect anything of that night that had passed, when suddenly, they were approached by a small girl who was frightened and upset.\n\nOn reaching them she was unable to talk so they gave her an apple, the traditional good luck charm of the movie. It seems the town was filled with the idea that the apple and the night were somehow linked, so maybe, they could get their help to find the other children, that this was indeed their lucky charm. Without asking if they knew where their children were, the girl and the young boy started out together, looking in the dark, in search of the missing children.\n\nWhat this movie tells us is perhaps how powerful childhood is in our life and how something as simple and innocent as an apple can mean so, so much, and why. We're given a chance to see and feel the power over fear that children posses and perhaps the strength we possess over life and our own decisions. All children are born as children, and children have always existed, right from the beginning of time. We can see this concept throughout history, and in the film, there are many things that remind the viewers that this is just a very, very, very, very, very, very early point in history with the use of characters similar to very old, very, very, very, very, very early people.\n\nI really like this movie (even if I did miss some key parts). It's kind of a dark movie and I would love to watch it again with all of the parts in. The fact it is scary doesn't really bother me, and is something that just makes it even stronger for me. But I do wish the ending with the old people and the two younger girls was longer. The ending is kinda weird, but I don't want to spoil anything! haha!\n\nAnyway, I really like this movie. It's a very beautiful film, to be perfectly honest with you.\n\nI'm feeling so inspired today to keep writing here on the site and keep it going, so keep coming back!\n\nI recently found myself being a bit of a pessimist in regards to the future of the UK TV industry and it is quite depressing to think about. Just like the last time I was pessimistic about things, I've been thinking about it a lot in recent days and I found myself looking at the many reasons why things are going the way they are and feeling quite angry!\n\nThe first thing I'm most annoyed about is that a show called \"EastEnders\" is currently in a place where an industry needs to make a special effort to make it work. There was a special programme on the Discovery Channel called \"The Real Hustle\" and we used to love watching it! It's a programme where four young, smart, professional and very ambitious people had to live in a small, confined, and challenging environment for three months of their choice.

{"text": "\"Ethiopian Jews are Israeli Jews in every way,\" said Roni Bienstock, an Israeli academic researching the history of Ethiopia and Jewish culture, adding that there was a \"direct ethnic correlation\" between Israeli Jews and Ethiopians who \"have the same language and share almost the same religion.\"\n\nAnthropologists, however, have called the term \"out of line with reality\" in part because there is little physical connection between Ethiopia and Israel.\n\nIsraeli author and journalist Idan D'Ami has said Ethiopia, like Morocco and Jordan, \"has historically been the home of the Jew.\"\n\n\"It's very hard to say these people are not Jewish,\" he said. \"They are the Jews of the Jews.\"\n\nYet, a handful of Jewish communities have existed in Ethiopia during the course of their history. There are about 1,000 Jews worldwide today, according to the Washington Office on Israel, including a few hundred Israelis in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. Many of those Israelis are Holocaust survivors. They live within a few minutes' drive on a quiet main road of Addis Ababa's neighborhood of Ketu. Their last name -- Solomon -- is not uncommon among the Jewish population.\n\nIsraeli Jews in Addis Ababa do not know their family history, having been dispersed by the Holocaust and escaping postwar persecution in Europe, according to Israeli author and journalist Idan D'Ami.\n\n\"When I'm asked, 'Where are you from?' I never have an answer,\" he said.\n\nThe few Ethiopian Jews who still remain in the region are confined to the capital. But they hope to one day integrate into the community there. About 150 of them are learning Hebrew and have their own local institutions for Jewish learning.\n\nSolomon, 65, was told when he was very young that his forefathers were Jewish. He remembers a teacher once asking his mother to go on a trip to Israel with one of the class' older children, so they could learn about the country.\n\n\"I heard her tell the child, 'I'm going with you,' and they went,\" Solomon said, smiling.\n\nOne of his friends also told him that his grandmother was Jewish, Solomon remembered. Another friend recalled that his brother had brought him a pair of gold rings before the war, which Solomon assumed were ceremonial, not religious.\n\nSolomon was born to a Christian family in a small village about 50 kilo meters west of Addis Ababa. During the Second World War, he and his family fled with the British. They never went back to Ethiopia.\n\nEven though few Jews live in Ethiopia today, a Hebrew translation of the Tanakh, the Jewish Bible, was published there in 1968, and Ethiopian Jewry still uses the Ethiopian calendar, which is based on the lunar calendar.\n\n\"We always had the feeling we were Jews,\" Solomon said.\n\nD'Ami, whose own family fled Ethiopia during the Holocaust, lives with the feeling that he's Jewish. But despite living as an Israeli, he doesn't understand the Ethiopian experience or have firsthand knowledge of being Ethiopian.\n\nEthiopia \"didn't need us to have a Jewish community,\" he said. \"No one ever thought Ethiopia would be a haven for Jews.\"\n\nToday, Israelis who have their roots in Ethiopia -- even those who aren't Jewish by birth -- are part of that community.\n\n\"I am Ethiopian, even though I don't have a drop of Ethiopian blood,\" said Rachel, 23, studying for a master's degree in medical anthropology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\n\"I grew up here,\" she said, holding her hand atop her head as she spoke. \"I was brought up an American.\"\n\nThis is what people in Addis Ababa also believe about their community. Rachel's family moved from Ethiopia to Israel and later returned. Since then, she has seen herself in the Ethiopian community.\n\n\"Even though I feel Ethiopian only because of the culture, I still identify myself as Israeli,\" she said proudly, as another American girl -- with dyed red hair -- turned around and looked on curiously.\n\n\"We are all Ethiopian by nature,\" said one young woman who declined to give her name.\n\nIn the past, many Ethiopians didn't want to be Israeli because they associated Israeli culture with a Westernization they said came first from the British. In recent years, though, Israeli culture as expressed by Ethiopians was changing.\n\nAn Israeli friend once told her that Israel was a Jewish country, and it showed the country's openness to accept all peoples and cultures from around the world. The country celebrated Christmas for the first time in 1996. A handful of Israeli churches are now open in Ethiopia, a church spokeswoman told ABC News. Ethiopian Israeli citizens are allowed to visit them. On New Year's Eve this year, millions of Ethiopians danced around bonfires all around the country, dressed in traditional garbs.\n\n\"When", "label": 1, "id": 100480}

Little is known about cognitive abilities in the subclinical stage of the disease. The aims of this study were to (i) analyze the pattern of cognitive alterations during the progression of cirrhosis, and (ii) evaluate the effects of blood sugar control in this condition.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe attentional and executive disorders associated with cirrhosis were estimated in a sample of 19 patients. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Trail Making Test A and B, Rey-Osterrieth Complex figure, Stroop Color/Word Test, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patients exhibited impairment on several clinical tests, including the number of total errors on the Trail Making Test (P = 0.001) and Stroop words test (P = 0.01), and the number of perseverations on the Rey complex figure (P = 0.05). A significant positive correlation was found among total errors and perseverative responses on the Trail Making Test (r = 0.72; P = 0.002) and a negative correlation was found between the age of onset of cirrhosis and the number of errors on the Stroop test (r = -0.66; P = 0.003). The patients in the experimental group had significantly fewer errors on the Stroop test (4.4 \u00b1 1.3 versus 11.4 \u00b1 3.8, respectively; P < 0.0001) and total errors on the Trail Making Test B (28.8 \u00b1 8.1 versus 36.6 \u00b1 9.6, respectively) than those in the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe show a significant reduction in the cognitive errors associated with both attention and executive processes in the subclinical stage of cirrhosis that is mediated by tight blood sugar control. These data demonstrate the need for controlled glucose administration to protect against the neurotoxic and antinithetic effects of HE.", "label": 1, "id": 100481}

{"text": "Woodfox was part of the group known as the \"Angola Three\" which was arrested in 1973 after being accused of aiding the Cuban communist regime in its efforts to destabilize Angola's government. Their charges were never upheld, and an appeal was rejected in 1976. In 1978 Fox and his colleague, Joe Remiro were pardoned but Woodfox, along with Robert Harris and Herman Wallace continued to serve their life sentences for the murder of Officer Ford.\n\nIn 1982, a civil lawsuit was filed against the Angola Three at Louisiana's federal district court. The lawsuit called for their immediate release and a retrial. However, neither the Louisiana or the state's federal district court ruled on the suit until more than 20 years later.\n\nIn 2006, the Angola Three was included in a list of inmates deemed eligible for commutation by Louisiana's governor at that time, Kathleen Blanco, who ordered their release. Governor Blanco described their case as \"the saddest in Louisiana history.\"\n\nHowever, the Louisiana Supreme court ruled against Fox, Remiro, and Woodfox's request on April 18, 2012, effectively blocking Fox and Woodfox's attempts to make a return trip home to West Virginia, despite their decades long incarceration and the fact that their convictions were vacated. The ruling was made by the Louisiana Supreme Court unanimously without written opinion. In a separate decision on the same day, a split 5\u20134 decision from the same court ordered Remiro to be released on a technicality, writing that because Remiro was convicted of an offense committed after December 12, 1972, the date of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Mississippi, he did not benefit from the U.S Supreme Court ruling. The two sides had also reached an out-of-court settlement for $200,000.\n\nWoodfox said the experience was painful:\n\nHe will die in prison. I don't want to say that is the only way, but I think all of us are here for some sort of purpose and the purpose hasn't come yet. There is somebody trying to bring it to pass, but the time isn't ripe. There will be a time for us. I have faith that it will happen in my lifetime, if it happens.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Woodfox's response if he knew he would die soon, said Christopher Hart, Woodfox's brother-in-law:\n\nYou are going to have an old, white, sad man, who has stood in this prison for over 40 years, die in a Louisiana prison because everyone who is a human and has a conscience in this country has the right to have the law of the land be applied to them in the United States of America. It's so ridiculous to me, that the law in Louisiana, in West Virginia, in Virginia \u2014 wherever they are \u2014 they have the right to apply their constitution to people the same as they are supposed to do in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn April 2016, Woodfox became eligible to apply for final discharge. Louisiana Corrections secretary James LeBlanc announced that Fox and Remiro would be eligible to apply for pardons on May 8. However, by May 11, he said that his staff was unable to confirm the eligibility in time, and Fox and Remiro would no longer be able to apply for a pardon. In spite of this reversal, Woodfox again expressed his hope that he would be released. On June 30, LeBlanc stated that two inmates had since been found eligible for the pardon. He called their eligibility \"an important milestone\" in the case, and he hoped it would be the first of many pardons. Both Woodfox and Remiro are still awaiting their commutation, and Fox could make a return journey to his home in West Virginia.\n\nRemiro filed for a writ of habeas corpus on July 27. On August 30, 2016, the New Orleans Orleans district court judge denied the writ, stating that the case was moot:\n\nThis Court is presented only with the question of mootness, and not the merits of applicant's case. Accordingly, the application for writ of habeas corpus is dismissed without prejudice. This decision does not moot the claims that petitioner is raising herein. If petitioner is convicted of any crimes while he remains incarcerated in Louisiana State Penitentiary [sic] (OSP), OSP will be barred from executing a sentence of life imprisonment for his convictions of having committed first-degree murder, and of unauthorized use of a movable because his convictions of those offenses predate the decision of June 9, 2016, in Foster v. U.S.,, \u2014 U.S., 135 S. Ct. 1074, 191 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2015). A judgment declaring OSP in violation of the Louisiana Constitution has not been rendered.

{"text": "Legally, only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in Canada. And if any of them get busted trying to hide illegal activity and students behind an educational fa\u00e7ade, it's not a crime to be a student at that school \u2013 it's a crime only for the school itself to be registered.\n\nBut since there are few or no consequences for the school, and even fewer for the schools' students, there are bound to be more and more of them.\n\nIf someone wants to open a non-profit and non-registered school, all they need is a bank account in their name, a bit of cash to start buying uniforms and supplies, and a phone number that's never registered to anyone. Then they simply send their students \u2013 children and teenagers \u2013 to the school.\n\nBut if that school is found to be \"illegal,\" where does it end?\n\nIf someone gets busted setting up a school \"in the wild,\" does the bust end it? Does the school get to keep teaching? Does it get to continue using its bank account?\n\nThe law is clear that schools whose existence could be considered \"illegal\" would be banned. It says any school receiving public funds or taxpayer money \"cannot use funds or accept payment for the tuition of students whose primary purpose is to participate in activities or receive instruction contrary to established practices of an educational institution.\"\n\nSo that means a school would be banned if it, in fact, turns out that the students aren't in the classroom, they're actually on a factory line, on a farm, on a prison bed, or doing manual labour.\n\nNow, the school is only considered \"illegal\" if it has a \"primary purpose\" contrary to established practices of an educational institution, which means you shouldn't confuse that with what a school might actually be teaching.\n\nThe law even gets specific: it refers to schools that teach prostitution, or drug use, or weapons or crime or any other illegal activity.\n\nBut these clauses have never been enforced.\n\nEven if a school fails to comply with these rules, the mere existence of the school is not illegal. The law only bars any school receiving government funds or tax money if it teaches things that \"contradict established practices of an educational institution.\" So even if a school fails to comply with one of these illegal-activity restrictions \u2013 as long as they're not teaching prostitution or drugs, you couldn't shut it down.\n\nThe school could be shut down, but the students would keep going there. The school may be declared illegal, but the students don't.\n\nNow for anyone who knows a school in the wild \u2013 you might as well not mention their location \u2013 who could try to shut it down?\n\n\"The education ministry would not be able to intervene, even though they could do so under the law,\" said an insider. \"They could shut it down, but the students are not committing a crime. So that's a big issue.\"\n\nThere's no reason to fear that the new federal government, given that \"the teachers are good and the kids are well off, the families are good,\" will open up the schools.\n\nWhat about the new Conservative government, elected with so many promises to reduce the deficit, with the stated intention of being \"accountable\" to the parents?\n\nThe insider was hopeful about that. \"They're the most fiscally conservative party right now so with their budget, they'd like to do a lot of reordering and make these things better. I think they want to be accountable to parents and parents can see what happened.\n\n\"It makes a lot of sense with the whole'school choice' thing.\n\n\"So parents actually have a choice these days, it's quite a good thing.\"\n\nThe school insider knows a lot about what's going on. \"You just have to talk to teachers and you know what their pay is and what their benefits and stuff like that.\n\nAnd she said, \"the teachers aren't afraid because they know that when they show up to work, they could actually get out and go. So that's pretty good. The teachers know that.\"\n\nThe schools in the wild that are actually registered and registered schools that are \"illegal\" wouldn't be targeted now, however, because they're just following the law.\n\nThe law doesn't have any provision for shutting down a registered school because it's illegal; instead, the schools that aren't registered get to keep teaching. They're just breaking the law, they said. But breaking the law isn't illegal, so there's nothing for anyone to do except for the teachers to stay home.\n\nThe government just has to be careful and \"get ahead of a storm,\" said the insider.\n\nShe said the government doesn't have the money to crack down on people who are teaching illegal subjects, but if there are enough teachers wanting to quit, the government \"would have to do something.\"\n", "label": 1, "id": 100484}

{"text": "Release: Q4, 2000 - Genre: Sports, duh - Console: PS1, NTSC, Retail - The PS1. Nowadays the gaming industry is dominated by the Playstation, but what was the biggest console of our time?\n\nThe year 2000 was quite a big year for Sony, starting with the release of the Playstation. While the Sega Dreamcast and N64 were dominating the market, PlayStation sales were growing and growing. The PlayStation 2 would later become the number one selling console in the world, as we look back on the PS1 it is still a true classic that can still be found in many gamers homes. At the height of Sony's popularity was in the middle of that year of 2000, in December, the gaming genius of Shigeru Miyamoto released the third game in what would be the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Series. The game was an instant success, which had everyone all worked up. Nintendo had created two legend of Zelda's before this. The first Legend of Zelda was Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past where Link was traveling to save the land from the evil Gannon. Ocarina of Time on the other hand, was a story of the princess Zelda traveling on a journey to rescue the sleeping princess on top of the tower known as the Lorule, while her friend Link helps her along his way. In the end everything was completed on her journey, but not before she falls into a deep sleep where she dreamt a secret dream of a man that could not talk. This man had to carry out the true purpose for his being, to wake her up. What would happen when this legendary trio came together? Ocarina of Time was an instant success with gamers of the day.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was also an instant favorite to many non-gamers and anime fans as the story of Link's journey through the Land of the Wind was based on the Japanese children's story of The Legend of Ninten. Although, Nintendo did not do much in the way of marketing Ocarina because of the success they had with the first two games. Although the game was still fairly new, in just a few month's since its release it already sold over 10 million copies. With Nintendo also trying to branch themselves out to other types of games besides those that were popular in the 1980's and 1990's, the company was trying to gain more exposure with their product. If Nintendo was trying to do this, then Sony sure as hell didn't want to be left out. Enter the PS1.\n\nPlayStation, as a company, was a whole new concept of gaming and entertainment. Unlike Sega or Atari, Sony was branching out into the areas of films, cartoons and many other types of media. By the time PlayStation hit the market, it was the dominant console, but when you look at sales numbers from just one year, you'll notice a big difference with Nintendo's sales against Microsoft's.\n\nThe PS1 was a new concept of gaming and also a new concept of entertainment. From the moment the PS1 came out to the world it took Sony the gaming market by storm. PlayStation owners were everywhere. In the time after the first few months and into 2006, there were still over 30 million PlayStation's sold. When the PS2 was released, it was an immediate hit. In the world of video games the PS1 is still one of the biggest and best systems that was ever made.\n\nHere is a look at the Top Rated Games of the PS1:\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 - PS1 - 10/10 - In the years after the 3rd Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Adventure, was released, Sonic was in a slump. All of a sudden, his gameplay was taken back to where they should be. All of a sudden Sega was having real problems making sure they could keep making Sonic games and other franchises, like Ecco the Dolphin. At the time Sonic 2 was Sonic's most recent game. Many gamers were tired of the series, while some, most notably me, still played every Sonic game to date from the arcade versions to the Sega released versions. I had this vision though, that would change Sonic's gameplay. If Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hadn't been my favorite Sonic game, then Sonic 3 would be my favorite Sonic game of all time. Sonic 3 was a big change from the first two games in that Sonic Adventure was a rail shooter, where Sonic would be travelling across a level and he could fly. In Sonic 3, Sonic could actually go right through everything, and at full speed, instead of running away. His game was back to his roots, and it was amazing.\n\nThe last time we had a rail shooter Sonic the Hedgehog game was at the end of 1994 with the release of Sonic 3.

The trailer gives no hint that there may be a story beyond \"Two idiots in a relationship fall for a girl they don't know.\" The fact that the title is taken from an ad for a different movie, and not a movie by James Cameron.\n\nThe premise is simple and, while it could be interesting, it is a hard concept to make the viewer care. The characters are morons that the writers don't seem to know. They write a lot of text instead of trying to find out what their characters like/dislike, don't like, dislike, hate, have no opinion about, etc. There are characters that have just enough personality to get them across the screen for a few moments. Even the two lead character have no depth. He is a young nerd in the military with a hard shell and she's the average, overweight, middle-class, high school, slut.\n\nThe story is that the main characters meet at some party. They start going out, but when they start going down a road of commitment, one of them is called up for duty, while the other leaves. It is just there for the girls to get back together and have their life figured out before they go to war. The war scenes never make any sense or go anywhere. Every other female character gets naked and has a relationship or sex scene, so they can make more sex scenes and try to make it better. The military scenes are boring and stupid. They are set in rural Wisconsin and the military doesn't even exist.\n\nThe end feels forced. There is no reason it should be like it was.\n\nWith a premise so ridiculous, it comes out as a pretty mediocre movie. The acting is just poor, and there is a lot of dialogue, which distracts from the actors. The actors really did not do that much. Their facial expressions were limited to showing they didn't like something. The dialog was limited to the few things that needed to be said. It was only in the sex scenes where the actors really had any emotion.\n\nThe movie was pretty badly written and poorly acted. The actors, while competent, had minimal emotional range. It was very predictable. If there is a takeaway from this, it should be that actors should have strong screen presence to make an entire movie worth seeing.\n\nYou know, this has the potential of a decent movie. I'm on board for a second time in my life. I think that James Cameron understands the need to give the audience a strong reason to watch a script that is in the development stages. The movie doesn't try to be a sex comedy. There is no forced romance or contrived events or anything like that. You have an unlikely romance between two morons that takes center stage. What do they like? They like sex, because that's there. Their relationship, outside of sex acts, is about keeping other people from knowing that they're in love. It's a really good concept, one that the audience doesn't even need to be told about. The character relationships are all laid back. You really don't see anybody as a total douchebag.\n\nThe acting is good. The script, the dialog, it is very solid. I see potential. It just needs to be developed. I'm on board for the sequel. James Cameron should consider an audience his number one priority, and he'll get a really good product.\n\nThe first time I saw this movie - I read online the plot (pretty boring too) but never saw it because when I wanted to the TV was blocked on my office (there were all good films)\n\nI saw it again and it was a bit dissapointing, to say the least.\n\nThis time I saw it with friend, but he told me it's the worst one of Cameron's movies so now I'm a bit nervous.\n\nHere is a more interesting plot and the movie is directed by John Singleton (see: BOF...)\n\nA guy named Robert wants to be a cop. He goes to the police academy and is good enough in his studies to get a police department job. After being there for a few years he starts getting into fights and things get even worse when he realizes that he feels more attracted to women and is very homophobic. He quits the force and goes to his father to plead with him and have him talk to the department head and ask to be given another chance. The father won't have it and the department head says that it's a good sign of commitment, \"he's got a family now, he's settled down, he's a man\". The father then gets shot and dies of his wound and Robert wants to quit his job and head to NY, as his ex-mother in law (who has been a very bad influence on", "label": 1, "id": 100487}
{"text": "His ascent to the post was the climax of a long career, a time when a new generation and a new political culture, both foreign and domestic, were shaping the country and, indeed, world politics for the next half century.\n\nMr. Reagan began his political career in the Goldwater insurgency of 1964 in Sacramento, Calif., a conservative counterculture made up of young people with little experience and a few of their parents.\n\nMr. Reagan, as political analyst David Brog, wrote, \u201cwas a small cog in the machinery of a new kind of politics, an electoral system engineered by people who were no longer of the old, dying Republican Party.\u201d\n\nBut he was always loyal to the party, though at times his actions seemed out of step with the political establishment of his day. In 1974, he denounced the Watergate break-in and the ensuing scandal \u2014 a direct slap in the face of then-President Richard M. Nixon and the Republican establishment.\n\nBy then, the political environment was being reshaped again. The so-called big-tent Republican Party was dying, replaced by a new generation of politicians and voters who had become increasingly alienated by Republican policies and politics. These new activists and officeholders, such as Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and George W. Bush, were less concerned with ideological purity and more interested in party loyalty than in winning elections. The old-guard Republicans, meanwhile, increasingly gravitated toward the Christian conservatives of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, led by the religious activists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.\n\nMr. Reagan\u2019s move toward the center in his first presidential bid gave him some credibility with the new voters. That credibility grew when the Reagan administration moved sharply to the center after the Iranian hostages were seized in 1980. By giving amnesty to thousands of prisoners and pardoning Richard M. Nixon, who resigned before his trial, Mr. Reagan seemed to be moving to the same center, only even further to the right. The president did not speak out at all against the Vietnam War until January 1981, and in July 1982, his administration lifted the trade embargo on the Soviet Union.\n\nBut some of his policies proved too extreme even for some of his die-hard supporters. Mr. Reagan\u2019s tax plan, which was so popular that it was adopted by most of the Republican Congress, would cut taxes significantly for the wealthiest two percent of Americans, increasing their share of the national budget. But it cut taxes on the average family roughly in half \u2014 something that most politicians, regardless of their ideology, would not have done without losing significant votes.\n\nIn 1982, in order to get his party to go along with him on a massive increase in defense spending and the military budget, Mr. Reagan had to force the Republican leaders to allow an amendment to the budget that took $34 billion away from social programs. As Ronald Reagan told a friend, \u201cIt was the biggest goddamned power play I ever saw in my political life. I was amazed at the leadership of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Reagan\u2019s record on defense was mixed, his foreign policy often seemed to reflect simple wishful thinking. In January 1981, he told the American people that the Soviet Union was \u201cthe focus of evil in the modern world.\u201d Yet, the following March, as his administration was preparing to invade Grenada, a Reagan administration adviser told The New York Times that no direct link between Mr. Reagan\u2019s call for support in Grenada and his call for a Soviet offensive had been made.\n\nThe Reagan years were a watershed in Washington, as he came to represent not so much the right as the Establishment, though he had a far narrower following inside or outside the country than Nixon or Eisenhower, who had both been nominated by their parties.\n\nThe Reagan administration, like the Reaganites inside the administration and even his core support group inside the party, was very conservative. But it was conservative with an agenda. That agenda was to build a strong military and take measures to restore the country and perhaps the world to full employment and an \u201ceconomic revival\u201d \u2014 even though inflation was rising.\n\nBut Mr. Reagan did not get it all his own way. He had no political machine to help him or to force his policies on reluctant members of Congress, though he did have some powerful friends, most prominently, Senate Minority Leader Robert H. Dole, the Kansas Republican.\n\nAnd by 1981, Mr. Reagan\u2019s once-famed eloquence had faded. He was far more disciplined than he used to be. And his health was beginning to decline.\n\nEven before Mr. Carter\u2019s election, Mr. Reagan\u2019s advisers thought of him as likely to die in the next presidential campaign, his aides say. Mr. Reagan, though, refused to make that assumption official.\n\n\u201cI see myself going on being president for a long,", "label": 1, "id": 100488}

{"text": "this is the second of a series of papers investigating the influence of the time-dependent inter-elemental interaction that may appear in the case of a finite collection of discrete interacting elements. In this second paper we aim at understanding if and how the time dependence of the interaction influences the evolution of the collective phenomenon of the inter-elemental state described by the instantaneous distribution of the mechanical energy in the system. In doing this, we start from an initial configuration of the system and let it evolve under a discrete time-evolution rule; this is described in more detail in refs [26, 41, 29, 32, 42]. By studying the distribution of the mechanical energy of each element of the system as a function of time, we have made a quantitative analysis aimed at measuring the role of the time-variable of the interaction and its influence on the evolution of the system. In particular, we study how the presence of a time-dependent interaction influences the ability of the system to maintain its original configuration (or, on the contrary, to evolve toward a configuration different from the initial one) at the end of the discrete time-step considered. We study this in the limit of weak interactions, that is for a case in which the interaction is not so strong as to destroy the original configuration of the system. Furthermore, we restrict to the simplest case in which the interaction between two neighboring discrete elements is proportional to the difference of their mechanical energy, and study the impact of this interaction on the evolution of the whole structure. In a future work, we will further consider the effects of a broader class of time-dependent interactions. Finally, we will analyze how the presence of a time-dependent interaction can influence the ability of the system to maintain its initial configuration at the end of the time step considered in the simulation.", "label": 1, "id": 100490}
{"text": "Each year, the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes. Yet only about 1 percent are so large that they\u2019re felt all over the world and have the potential to do some damage. There\u2019s another 10 or so earthquakes per day, and all the little quakes (a few magnitude-1.0 to 3.0) are \u201cnoise,\u201d says Paul Earle, a seismologist at the Southern California Earthquake Center in Los Angeles. The real threats are the big ones (that are rare, and last longer than a few minutes).\n\nEarth\u2019s surface has moved about 8,000 times in the last 300 million years, and the average frequency is about once every 20,000 years, says David Jackson, a seismologist at the Geological Society of America, who presented his findings Monday (June 29) at the group\u2019s national convention in Boston. \u201cThat\u2019s still a pretty noisy world,\u201d Jackson says. (Read about how earthquakes are a danger to people and wildlife.)\n\nNow it looks like the Earth\u2019s movement has changed. In the past 35 years, it\u2019s switched gears to be more active than usual. It\u2019s still not unusual for earthquakes to pop up, but historically they were about once every 80-100 years. \u201cOver the last decade [there\u2019s been] an acceleration of seismic activity,\u201d says seismologist William Ellsworth, who works in the seismology division at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.\n\nThe increase could mean the beginning of the end for the Pacific Ocean\u2019s large underwater earthquakes (which are called tsunamis). They make up 40 percent of all earthquakes and can generate waves as high as 30 meters (100 feet). About 300 million years ago, the Cascadia subduction zone under the ocean floor made a small earthquake. \u201cAnd you had this giant tsunami coming out,\u201d says seismologist Steve Nadeau. It\u2019s not known what the tsunami left behind, but it had a big impact on the area\u2019s inhabitants, which include whales.\n\nCascadia subduction zone, an underwater fault which runs more than 600 kilometers (365 miles) off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The Pacific plate is moving westward underneath the North American plate, and eventually it will slip and slide north, triggering a huge undersea earthquake and resulting in a giant tsunami. (Illustration by J.F. Allen / Science Photo Library)\n\nThis year is a particularly good year for these giant quakes to happen. Researchers have a pretty good idea of where the next one will be happening and a good idea of its magnitude (from an analysis of how far the ground moved seismologists can usually predict the depth of a quake, and that gives them an idea of how big it might be). So it\u2019s a very good plan to go outside and enjoy the beach. In the Pacific Northwest, we\u2019ll be getting more frequent but far smaller quakes \u2014 the most dangerous part comes next, when big waves from offshore cause severe damage on the coast.\n\nIn 2010, two magnitude-9 earthquakes hit off Japan\u2019s northern Chiba Prefecture and Hokkaid, and Japan and China. The quakes were probably caused by the same fault, says seismologist Katsuhiko Ishibashi of Kobe University in western Japan. But if we have two, how do we know which one started? It\u2019s still not clear. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take years for this event to unravel,\u201d says Nadeau. Researchers in Japan have collected rocks and sediments from the site, and it will take several years for them to find out exactly what went down.\n\nAn earthquake can cause a tsunami by shaking loose a small amount of sea water. This water sloshes outward, causing a wave front that moves out into the ocean. When the wave front reaches shallow water, it creates a large surge in pressure. That\u2019s a tsunami. These waves, although typically smaller, can be big, up to 30 meters in height.\n\nThe largest recorded tsunami was a magnitude-9.0 in Japan\u2019s 1891 Kumagawa event. However, this event produced a tsunami in just 10-15 minutes.\n\nAn example of the damage a tsunami can cause. Here, a building at Okura Hotel in Iwamizawa, Japan, takes a hit from the tsunami that occurred at 6:38 a.m. on March 19, 1991. The tsunami smashed a car into the hotel\u2019s side door, crushing the glass and leaving debris scattered on the lobby floor.\n\nSince the last big earthquake in Japan, scientists have become a good deal more accurate at predicting where it will occur. Japanese scientists now calculate that a big earthquake off Japan could happen anywhere along a 400 kilomet", "label": 1, "id": 100491}
{"text": "Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"\"McCabe\"\" (based on Naughton's own novel), has not much in common with his last two features \"\"Badlands''\" and \"\"Nashville\"\" -- aside from Naughton and the locale -- but even the latter showed an understanding of the West's cultural myth, which Altman doesn't have (yet). Unlike both his recent features, this one is a straightforward Western rather than a parodic one. The story concerns \"Billy\" (Woody Strode, with occasional help from Burt Reynolds and Strode's co-star, Farrah Fawcett). He sets out to recover a stolen horse, taking on assorted outlaws and vengeful ranchers along the way. The action takes place about 1868 in the town of \"McCabe\", later renamed \"Sink\" and located somewhere along the Texas-Mexico border. This area is depicted as a mixture of the Old West and of Hollywood Westerns, with cowboy hats, wigs, long flowing silky drapes on Western saloon doors, and a movie-making studio set which includes a Western \"pony express\" stagecoach. Billy is first spotted by a gang of Confederate soldiers from the \"Confederate States of Southern California\" who have no trouble stealing the horse, a fact which suggests that their purpose is more than just a straightforward robbery. (This leads to a memorable scene in which the Confederate soldiers find themselves literally caught between a \"Yankee\" soldier and the camera, being shot on cue by Strode to indicate their death.) It is not long before Billy and his new companions meet Doc Smith (Alan Rickman) and his friends: the tough but kindly \"Doc\" and the good-looking but dim-witted \"Casper\". They ride with the band to a nearby \"Mexican\" village, where Billy's friends find themselves under suspicion of being Indians (the village folks are in fact Mexicans) and are given refuge by a mysterious and ominous Mexican villager (who plays to the audience, making it difficult to tell whether he is a friendly or an enemy). The two gangs meet at a gambling match, then depart to their various destinations. On their way, the cowboys come across a wounded young \"Mexican\" man tied to railroad tracks. They stop to offer him aid, then he shoots and kills Johnny \"Wrangler\" Rook (Jason Bernard), an Indian scout for the railroad. When the boys ride to the nearest town, more Mexicans are ambushed and killed or wounded by their assailants, who then disappear into the night. Billy's horse then collapses, and he is joined by two girls on a horse, both of whom are kidnapped by an escaped convict named \"Buck\" Thornton and a gang of outlaws. The boys arrive at a \"stagecoach\" station, where they find a group of prostitutes and gunfighters -- \"Pancho\" Chavez (Tony Shalhoub), \"Pepe\" (Michael Badalucco) -- and their leader \"Sheriff Brady\" (Bill McKinney), an outlaw on the run. Sheriff Brady attempts to steal the goods on the stage to finance an assassination, but this leads to a gun battle which kills his men and Peptone's, and leaves Thornton (Peter Jurasik) with a bullet in his shoulder, leading to his arrest by the boys. The next day, Thornton and his men are taken to the town jail, where the boys free him (by shooting the jail bars) and take the sheriff and his men prisoners, planning to take them to Las Vegas to be hanged. Unfortunately, the \"Mexican\" is still alive and will be taken to Las Vegas (where he turns out to be the village chief)...\n\nThis movie has a good cast: it shows that Farrah Fawcett can play the tough girl, though not the good girl. In a film about the Old West, where the line between good, bad, and downright evil has a fuzzy character, she is only moderately sympathetic. I didn't mind her casting because I always find actors like her attractive, but she does not bring much dimension to the character. In fact, she is the one who reminds me the most of the old Mary Ann (I did not mean that in a sexual way) in that she is a bit of a harridan. Woody Strode, on the other hand, is very strong in this role: that is partly to be expected, and partly because he is a much more convincing, likable actor than is Fawcett. This comes as a surprise, not because he's a really mediocre actor, but because his acting has a quality which suggests that he is better suited to the character he plays. As I have written many times before, I love Woody Strode. I do not think he is anywhere as good as he was in earlier pictures (though he is better than a lot of other \"B\" actors --", "label": 1, "id": 100492}

The troops will remain in Syria through the end of the year at the earliest, according to US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, while he told CNN that Washington is \u201clooking to provide a continued stabilizing effect.\u201d\n\nWhile the US officials are not ready to rule out the option for the eventual retreat from the country, the Pentagon leadership has admitted that Washington\u2019s \u201cstabilizing\u201d impact on Syria is not a concrete plan, and will depend on \u201cfurther decisions\u201d made by US President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the US is not planning to increase its military presence in Syria by deploying more troops. According to Hagel, US troops will remain on the ground for the next several months.\n\nThe US officials have repeatedly admitted that they maintain troops in Syria, but refused to give any details about the deployment or a timeline.\n\nThis week was declared as the start of the \u201cnew\u201d US military strategy in the Middle East, when the Pentagon revealed that it does not foresee the need for further troops deployments in the region.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon has never discussed the exact number of soldiers in Syria, Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned the Russian Federation not to underestimate Washington\u2019s military strength and said that the US troops are there \u201cto maintain the balance.\u201d\n\nPentagon officials have also said that Syria cannot be a part of the \u201creordered\u201d Middle East without a \u201cstrong US military presence.\u201d Last November, the Defense Secretary noted that the US troops in Syria have been deployed to prevent \u201cmission\u201d creep in the Middle East without directly referring to Turkey\u2019s growing military presence in the country.\n\nThe US troops in Syria currently have very limited roles to perform, said Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding that Washington\u2019s intervention in Syria serves as \u201can insurance policy\u201d for the region. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs has also refused to confirm rumors about the withdrawal of US troops from Syria in the case of a new US withdrawal from Iraq, noting that they are not \u201con the table\u201d in any possible solution for Iraq.\n\nThe US troops are deployed in seven US bases, and the Pentagon has deployed the first drone squadron of the US Air Force. In May of this year, a US drone deployed its first strike against armed militants in Syria, killing about a dozen of them.\n\nThe Pentagon also admitted to a high degree of uncertainty whether the deployment of US troops, which is opposed by Russia, Iran, China, Iraq, and Syria, is going to be successful, but said the US troops in Syria are ready to \u201cperform [their] missions without delay.\u201d\n\nAlthough the US administration has not publicly admitted that it was going to withdraw its troops from Syria, Pentagon officials have said it is going to take no action without \u201cthe direction of the president.\u201d The US deployment of the drone squadrons also shows that Turkey is planning a possible military action against Syrian forces in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish military has intensified the attacks at the Syrian border, shelling an area near the Syrian town of Tell Hamees, while a Russian Su-25 aircraft, along with two Mi-17 helicopters, were scrambled over Ain Issa. Turkish forces have fired multiple artillery shells at the Syrian town, while Syrian Air Force strikes targeted Ain Issa and destroyed five rebel positions on the Turkish border, Al-Masdar News reported.\n\nThe US and the EU have criticized the Turkish bombardment at the Syrian border and said that it supports the armed terrorist groups in the country.\n\nSince mid-September, the Turkish military has intensified its shelling against Ain Issa, firing over 200 artillery shells, while Syrian Army troops killed a number of Turkish mercenaries in the region. The Turkish shelling of the Syrian territory, which was accompanied by the use of mortars and heavy machine guns, is widely perceived in the Syria as a provocation.\n\nRussia has repeatedly urged Turkey and the West not to intervene in Syria, stressing that such actions are destabilizing Middle East.\n\nOn October 17, Russia\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said that the countries that have intervened in Syria have \u201cbroken up this entire region,\u201d and that such actions are destabilizing the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish military forces", "label": 1, "id": 100495}
{"text": "We have reported on the conflict in Syria since the beginning of 2011. Over the course of that time, the conflict has morphed from a protest movement to the world\u2019s most deadly war. At home, the conflict has split the country. The Assad government, backed by its ally Russia, has remained strong, and has largely succeeded in pacifying most of the cities and towns that rose up against Assad in 2011.\n\nBut while the violence has ebbed outside of Damascus and Aleppo, the uprising \u2014 and its aftermath \u2014 has left many families divided and torn apart. In the past weeks, we\u2019ve seen the beginnings of a slow return to normality in the city of Homs as the government and its backers have made some progress in pacifying the city. But the situation remains volatile, with the Syrian army still maintaining control of parts of the city, and opposition forces still maintaining control of parts of the eastern suburbs of Homs.\n\nIn the rest of the country, things are largely still as they have been for the past five years. The Assad government continues to suppress the free flow of information. It continues to use human rights groups and international organizations to frame its story about Syria as a human rights crisis, ignoring international law and international human rights law. And it continues to maintain control of large swaths of Syria, even as it is losing influence over key parts of the cities that rose up against it.\n\nTo understand what life is like inside Syria today, we are speaking with the author of a new book about the conflict between Syria\u2019s government and its people, and the family of a Syrian-American woman whose home has been occupied by opposition fighters.\n\nWhen we\u2019re finished speaking, we\u2019ll take you through the basics of this week\u2019s news. But first, this week\u2019s Five Questions with Michael Totten:\n\nFive Questions with Michael Totten\n\nWhat was going on at the Syrian protests in late 2011?\n\nThe protest movement was born out of a deep sense of the utter rottenness of Syrian society, and the utter failure of the Syrian state to do anything about it. That sense of rottenness developed over almost the entire length of the period of Ba\u2019ath rule. There\u2019s no doubt about that. There have been some periods throughout the entire period of Ba\u2019ath rule where more people have been fed. But that was followed by long periods where there were famine and epidemics and things of that sort. There were great waves of arrests and arbitrary executions, and the regime was always very good at creating those waves of fear and that sense of rottenness, that it couldn\u2019t care less about who you are and what you do. And of course, at times, the whole society itself turned into a kind of a giant prison. It\u2019s hard enough to stay alive in Syria without having to worry very much about being arrested, or about execution, or about being killed for no reason except that it\u2019s very unpleasant for your relatives to have to bury you, or for them to have to mourn what may have happened to you. And that was all that really happened in the first three years.\n\nThen, everything went ballistic. At the very beginning of the revolt, the Syrian army mobilized to crush the protesters in their encampments around the country, the National Security Agency started its electronic warfare campaign, that\u2019s when they started to cut off mobile phone service, to cut off the Internet, all that stuff. And then, you get the army\u2019s use of snipers against protesters at first, against the Free Syrian Army who were trying to organize and protect their efforts. In effect, the regime did exactly what Saddam Hussein did to the people of Iraq, and that\u2019s what caused the protests in the first place, in 2011. In 2011, the Syrian army and the security services, or at least parts of them, were still under the command of the officer corps that had grown up under Hafez Assad (Syria\u2019s president from 1971 to 2000) and which was closely allied with the Ba\u2019ath party, all of whose leading figures were still alive and very powerful. So they took to the streets with their AK-47s, and killed the protesters, many of them quite coldly. Almost 10,000 people were killed, all of them by bullets intended to kill. The rest of the time, the security forces were trying to kill protesters simply because they wanted not to have to listen to anything they said.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on at the Syrian protests today?\n\nAt the protest camp north of Homs, over the past four or five days, the Syrian Army has surrounded the camp, and it\u2019s been doing this in cooperation with other pro-government forces. They are apparently moving in two battalions, one from the south of Syria, and the other moving slowly eastward toward Aleppo City, from the Aleppo countryside.", "label": 1, "id": 100496}
{"text": "Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted to end their country's 307-year-old link to the British monarch, Scotland went from being in the hands of a conservative Tory government for over a decade of prosperity to a Labour-dominated parliament for a decade of austerity.\n\nThe Scottish economy and society has grown and prospered under successive Labour and Labour Unionist government's, with the country, now officially the 'Third Republic' of the United Kingdom, now boasting the world's fastest growing economy.\n\nThe decision to separate Scotland was made by the United Kingdom, the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament and the United Nations. The issue is complex, and as such will be covered in full in our Guide to Constitutional Politics and the Independence Referendum. However, for the sake of those who will read the guide later, but also those who are interested enough to want to read it, this will cover the most topical aspects of independence.\n\nThe British Economy\n\nThe economic miracle that is Britain is not the creation of either of the main political parties, it is merely the result of Labour's and Labour Unionist's successful management of the nation's economic policies.\n\nAs of June 2000, the UK had a Gross Domestic Product of \u00a32.7 trillion. A few months earlier it had been \u00a31 trillion. The result of that growth has been Britain's growing economic power abroad as opposed to the nation's declining financial power domestically. The government of that time, Conservative, led by Margaret Thatcher, managed to reduce debt, inflation and unemployment, while increasing wealth in such measures as investment.\n\nThroughout the 1980's and 1990's, the conservative party, led by Margaret Thatcher in the UK, and presidents Ronald Reagan in the US and Helmut Kohl in Germany, began the trend of making economic growth and prosperity the core issue of democratic government. The conservative movement was initially the result of anger towards big spending, high taxation policies of the Labour party, of whom Margaret Thatcher, Thatcherism and Conservatism have become synonymous. The subsequent result of the policies of the conservative party, and the success they achieved, has been a surge in the wealth and power of the UK economy, while simultaneously reducing the power of the government in terms of spending and taxation, as they have become the party of the rich.\n\nThis has lead to several consequences regarding the economic policies of the Conservative and Conservative Unionist government's. Firstly, the Conservative government began reducing employment, unemployment has since fallen to 3.5%, the UK's lowest level since 1975. This means the government should have less incentive to fund the services previously paid for by unemployment, yet the result has been a continuation of the 'northern powerhouse' industrial policies that made Thatcher's Tory's popular, such as the 'Big Bang' programme which reduced the number of local councillors from 80,000 to 20,000. More recently, the government has been looking to increase funding for health and social services. A move which is unpopular among the electorate, as it is the only party that voted against the reduction in local council funding, but also the only party who doesn't believe in raising the taxes to pay for it.\n\nIn turn, as the government has increasingly tried to shift money from the working class, the electorate has increasingly responded by demanding the reduction of spending on social services.\n\nIn addition to this, as a result of the increased power of the private sector in the economy, the government was able to shift all of the power to raise revenue and spend it on public services from the government to private companies. A shift which has been successful in most cases, as tax evasion through the use of companies and offshore tax havens has been reduced significantly through the efforts of both the Labour and Conservative government's. The most recent example of this in action is the introduction of the 'Google tax' (an effective income tax based on the number of searches that take place in the nation) and the introduction of the 'Google tax' (an effective income tax based on the number of searches that take place in the nation), which was introduced alongside the 'internet revolution' that is the internet.\n\nScotland's Economy\n\nAs of 2003, the economic situation in Scotland was largely similar to the rest of the United Kingdom. Though there has been an increase of unemployment, the highest in twenty years, as of 2001, the growth of the Scotland's Gross Domestic Product was the world's fastest, rising at a rate of 7% over the course of that year.\n\nAfter the devolution of control over policy towards Scotland's economic future, its economy began to slow. In 1990, Scottish GDP was \u00a321 billion, by 2000 it was \u00a330 billion.\n\nScotland's population, which also grew during the 90's, also contributed to this slowdown, when in 1995, Scotland had a population of 5.7 million people. In 2006, Scotland was the fifth most populous country in Europe, with 6.29 million residents, a figure which continued to grow", "label": 1, "id": 100497}

I believe that if Spencer Pratt didn\u2019t do anything in order to make money, then he didn\u2019t make half the money he does now. As of late, you have been seeing it on blogs, blogs (mainly Perez Hilton), and even other websites that Spencer Pratt has a net worth of around half a billion dollars. Why do you think that is? Because Spencer is making money through his clothing company, that is why. I don\u2019t believe that Spencer Pratt would go through all of this trouble if it wasn\u2019t for money, Spencer is way too stupid to think that way.\n\nAs for the question: When do you think that Heidi will go public about her drug abuse? I don\u2019t think that she is doing it anymore, and she was pretty bad when she did it, but if something happens to her it will come out. Heidi and Spencer always did a lot of drugs in their relationship. I would never believe that Heidi went to any rehab place that is private, because they want her to keep rehabbing until she has her next tattoo, or whatever reason they tell her is the reason she needs rehab.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in getting back together, but I still like the idea of Heidi trying to get another boyfriend who is more down to earth.

She\u2019s not going to jail though, obviously, and maybe they\u2019ll let her go because she was driving, not a pedestrian. I don\u2019t think she will be going to jail though.

{"text": "This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. All the actors are in love with themselves, and the movie is even worse than most of the things the stars themselves produce. I'm quite happy to say that this is one of the worst movies of all time.\n\nIf I was honest, this would be the best of a very low group that includes this, the terrible \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and \"Star Trek IV\". But at the same time, it's not one of the worst movies ever made -- though you can have some fun thinking about why.\n\nA film is called \"The Best of All Worlds\", but it's really a great example of being \"None of the above\". It's a film about a man who's a robot with human-alien/machine/superheated fusion DNA. He develops a conscience, becomes a good man and decides to end his life.\n\nIf you have the heart to watch two minutes of this movie, I'll make a deal with you that after I finish my review you will buy me a drink.\n\nThe film is very pretentious, and is very poorly made. The actors are in love with themselves, and it's the most awful, pretentious film ever made -- as it just seems to be a film made for people like the crew of the Starship It's A Wonderful Life, and other people who have the same attitude of being in love with themselves.\n\nAll the actors were actually good in this, but they all felt the way they felt to give the film its pretentious tone.\n\nThis is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. However, it does contain that one scene where that guy, who has the most lines of dialogue in the most movies ever, gets out a gun. And as soon as you see him take the gun out, you realise how badly the director of this movie has made the entire film.\n\nThis is a bad movie, that will be remembered more by those people who think movies about aliens are terrible.\n\nThere's no point telling you more about this film, as it makes no sense at all.\n\nThis film is so bad it's actually good, and is actually so good it's bad.\n\nIf I was honest, it probably isn't too bad. It has some good scenes, as well as some awful one. It's the kind of film that no other film, or movie franchise, wants to be. If you like this film, there's nothing that you are going to be able to do better, as this will be the film of your dreams.\n\nThe reason you can give this a good review is because you really like to be challenged on how you actually feel about any subject. And \"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Godzilla\" do challenge anything you consider to be true.\n\nIf people were able to sit down and watch this film and actually say \"This is just rubbish\", then there could be some good out of it, but it doesn't.\n\nIf you want to know my review of this movie, you'll find it on the second page of this article, where you can learn how it's a film about alien-human fusion people who turn into lizards because I don't want to write a three-page review on this film.\n\nThe plot involves the invasion of Earth by alien lizard men, and the only way to stop them is for the lizards to get into people's heads. That's a great idea for a film, but it doesn't hold up. There are a lot of other good ideas for a film in this movie, but there are too many bad ones, as well. The aliens with human-lizard fusion DNA could have been some of the best aliens ever in a film, but they're just horrible. They look like human beings with lizards' heads, and they act like them, too.\n\nSome of the acting was good, but there's no telling what kind of acting was in this movie, as there are so many different types.\n\nIf you're interested, I have a review of this bad film here. It's a review of one of the worst films ever made, and tells how it's a terrible film that should have been completely forgotten.\n\nIf you're going to watch this film, make sure you watch it with headphones. That way, you can enjoy the entire film with no sound at all -- since this is a silent movie. It's actually a film made for a silent film.\n\nThe only reason I watched this film was for the scene in it where a character makes a gun. And that's exactly the worst part of this terrible film.\n\nThis movie tells the story of a man, who has an alien who's also a robot in his head. He becomes a good person and decides to escape from where he's being held. There are other good parts to this movie, but they're too", "label": 1, "id": 100502}
{"text": "She was speaking after a meeting of the Scottish cabinet at the Scottish Office in Edinburgh on Friday.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWe have an international convention against torture. So it would be very difficult for Scotland to go outside that convention and take part in that activity.\u201d She said \u201cI am looking forward to speaking to my colleagues at Westminster on this matter.\u201d\n\nIn January Human Rights Watch Scotland claimed the UK government had failed to take \u201csteps to prevent complicity in torture by UK residents and UK nationals suspected of involvement with the UK\u2019s clandestine secret interrogation and detention programme to which at least two Scottish citizens have allegedly been subjected\u201d.\n\nIt said it had uncovered \u201cclear evidence that suspects are being unlawfully subject to incommunicado detention in Scotland as well as in the south of England\u201d in part because \u201cthe UK government has not moved to prohibit the UK-wide use of secret detention without charge\u201d.\n\nThe charity said UK nationals including an alleged high-ranking former MI6 officer were continuing to face prosecution and imprisonment in Scotland even after they left the UK and had fled the justice system in other jurisdictions.\n\nAt a news conference in February, the Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the UK government had assured the Scottish justice system that \u201cthe situation in respect of the UK\u2019s secret detention policy in Scotland is as it is in England, Scotland and Wales\u201d.\n\nBut he added: \u201cScotland remains a jurisdiction where people can be detained and put in secret locations without being charged or appearing before a court. It is not a matter for speculation. We have been assured by Scotland Office officials that this is no longer the case.\u201d\n\nIn his statement in the Scottish parliament on Thursday, the Labour MSP added: \u201cThe Scottish government must take steps immediately to prevent complicity in torture.\n\n\u201cOne of the most appalling human rights abuses since the Second World War has been the CIA\u2019s notorious interrogation and detention programme in Europe, which has included the UK.\n\n\u201cI am alarmed by the continuing abuse of the United States\u2019 own legal obligations on torture. It is only right that Scotland looks to see how its laws measure up to international standards.\n\n\u201cScotland will do all it can, working with the United Nations and other allies, to end any practice or policy which contravenes the UN Convention Against Torture.\u201d\n\nHe said Scotland was \u201cwell aware of the Scottish people\u2019s clear commitment to the rule of law and to international treaties. We must make Scotland\u2019s laws conform to international standards.\u201d\n\nHis colleague, the SNP MSP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, Eilidh MacLeod, said: \u201cIt is important that we act to ensure that the UK government respects Scotland\u2019s position as a signatory to the UK-wide prohibition of torture.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have been a country which helped to make torture unthinkable \u2013 and which is determined to make sure that other countries do the same.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish Government said it understood that \u201cunder article 7 of the UN Convention against Torture, there is no provision for the UK to prevent Scots from being tortured\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said: \u201cThe Scottish government will be taking a close interest in the case against Mhamed Kaddour, and will take full account of our obligations under international human rights law, including the provisions of the UN Convention against Torture.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, after the UK cabinet meeting, Mr Matheson said: \u201cIn light of the fact and at the request of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Secretary asked the UK home secretary to invite the chief commissioner of the Scottish police to accompany him to his ministerial meeting with the UK home secretary on 6 April.\n\n\u201cThe chief commissioner will offer an update on the Scottish Government\u2019s review of the investigation around the disappearance of Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents.\u201d", "label": 1, "id": 100503}
{"text": "[ purpose ] the purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence\na professional nurse with her decision to leave her current place of work,\nwhere she has been trained in both nursing and hospital administration.\n\n[ design ] the authors' thesis study uses a combination of grounded theory and\nquantitative techniques.\n\n[ background ] in order to have a working relationship with the nurses and\nadministrators of a regional hospital, the researcher had to first work as a nurse,\na clinical area manager, and an administrator prior to beginning data\ncollection.\n\n[ methods ] the authors' methodological procedure included the following: the\nauthors used grounded theory methods to identify the factors that influence\nthe decision of a professional nurse to leave her current place of work in a\nregional hospital, where she has been trained in both nursing and hospital\nadministration. Quantitative methods were used to compare the career\ncommitment of those nurses that have chosen to leave with those who chose not\nto.\n\n[ results ] the decision to leave the profession was a result of either poor\nwork environment, staff shortages, or both. The poor work environment was due\nto work stress, staff shortages, and a high work load.\n\n[ discussion ] the high work load and staff shortage are consistent with\nanother study of nurses in New York City, and the finding that the work\nenvironment played a larger role in the decision of the experienced nurses to\nleave their professional career than the staff shortage factor. This suggests\nthat the nurses who stay stay because they have a sense of loyalty to the job\nor are influenced to stay by the rewards, advancement opportunities, or even\nfamily or personal obligations in their job.\n\n[ conclusion ] the authors would recommend that hospital administrators address\nthis issue before it becomes too late because nursing shortages have reached the\npoint that hospitals are becoming incapable of meeting patient care needs.\n\nIn the context of\n\n[ purpose ] the question that this study has posed to the professional nurse is\nwhat\n\n[ background ] the author's thesis study combines the use of grounded theory and\nquantitative research methods.\n\n[ design ] the study is based on the qualitative research design which utilizes\nin depth interviews with both the sample as well as focus group\nsessions.\n\n[ methods ] in order to be able to collect data as they occur, the authors used\ncategorical or non-numeric codes. These codes include: the purpose, the\nmethods and the results.\n\n[ results ] the results were collected using the grounded theory approach. A\ncoding tree was produced which was sorted into the various categories. These\ncoding categories were used to answer the research question of what influenced\nnursing professionals to leave their jobs.\n\n[ discussion ] there were four themes found: the staff shortage was the primary\ninfluence on the decisions to be made either to leave the job or stay; the\nwork environment was the second factor influencing the decision; family\nconcerns and/ or marriage were the third factor; and the rewards such as\nenjoyment and financial issues were the fourth factor.\n\n[ conclusion ] in order to promote the quality of health care to a larger\nnumber of patients, the author is of the opinion that every nurse working in\nthis profession should be provided with a better work place and more\nopportunities for advancement.\n\n[ purpose ] the aim of this thesis is to show that there is no single solution\nto the nursing shortage in the state of Delaware. Since the nurse is an integral\nmember of the health care team, it is essential to the quality of patient care\nthat adequate numbers be available.\n\n[ background ] the author began with several questions which she addressed through\na series of interviews with individuals at all levels ranging from administrators,\nmanagers and nurses to the practicing nurses directly involved with patient care.\n\n[ design ] the study was performed by reviewing documents, conducting interviews,\nobtaining data from the health care data base and analyzing the data. With the\nuse of qualitative techniques, the data were grouped and analyzed to draw\nconclusions. One of the first steps the researcher took was to determine the\npurpose of the study.\n\n[ methods ] the author determined that qualitative analysis of the data would be\nimportant since she was a new researcher at the research institution.\n\n[ results ] the major theme found was that, although every facility does have\npatients that have a problem, such problems only seem to occur on a small scale.\n\n[ results ] the second theme found was that of financial problems. In this area,\nnurses found not only that they receive a low wage, but a low cost per capita\nper diem rate. In addition, there are problems with benefits.

{"text": "did it), an enigmatic occultist finds and trains her to be a master of the arts to fight on the front lines of the War against the Shadow, a group of rebels led by General Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nIt's probably safe to say that no one has ever seen a girl go from strength to strength like this before: She is a powerhouse who, at first glance, makes every other character feel like a pathetic weakling, and yet she is still somehow capable of doing extraordinary and impossible feats. It'll be challenging and fun to see her continue to develop as the game progresses.\n\nYou, on the other hand, as the player, feel like a nobody who's in a war you had no idea you were ever even in. No one was ever going to recognize you for helping one of the few superheroes in the entire world, and yet, as soon as all of the pieces start to fall into place, you realize that your name is on the list of things that the government is paying attention to. Who are you?!\n\nThe story is not written well. The dialogue is awkward, and the exposition is just about as clunky as it gets, but, once the story gets rolling, you really can't help but like the characters and feel invested in them and their goals.\n\nIt's really refreshing to have a superhero series that's not just centered on some kind of ubermensch like Aquaman or Wolverine. It was refreshing to not feel like I'm playing someone who spends the game constantly fighting to survive another encounter with the bad guys, or trying to find out what the plot of the story is so I can get back to the part of my life I should be worrying about; a series that puts me into the shoes of the villains. There is not a weak link in the entire series, which keeps the pace of the gameplay up, and as each part of the story unfolds, I felt like I really had a sense of where each part was leading me and what I was trying to do. There were times when I found myself frustrated because I wished I could just skip forward in time and skip through all of the exposition, but a scene I had to go to was well-written enough to make you feel like you actually needed to be there, and it was a good lesson: sometimes, the story just isn't about you.\n\nAt the same time, the characters don't just sit there and spout exposition all the time. They'll make you feel like you're having a conversation with someone you know, or a debate, or a war council. Even though this series has no dialogue or character customization, it made me feel like it absolutely should have both of those things considering that the entire premise is centered around the conversation between characters.\n\nAnd, of course, the gameplay takes advantage of it. There are loads of options and variations that let you use your own style of play: you can fight hand to hand, jump into the air, use a gun or a blade or your magical abilities, make other characters use their powers, turn them into your allies, manipulate their powers and so on. It's up to you how you'd like to play, but it's hard not to come away from the game thinking that the developers really thought through every aspect of what they were making and wanted to be able to make it play as many different ways as they could. The controls were always intuitive and responsive as long as you had the right setup.\n\nIn summary: despite the clunky dialogue and awkward exposition, this is easily the best video game ever released for the Playstation 4 and it may be the best in the entire series. It's fast-paced, engaging, and a real blast to play.", "label": 1, "id": 100506}

Film is made in such a creative way that almost none of the films ever finish, and the first movie made by a director always end up in the wrong place. I am telling you that only the very first movie made by a director ever ends in the right place. Some directors don\u2019t even make a film. They say they want to, but they never do.\n\nI believe I should know a thing or two about film. I\u2019ve watched a lot of films and I\u2019ve thought a lot about film and I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m really an expert. The problem is that, because I\u2019ve watched so many films, I can\u2019t say for certain whether my analysis is true. This is just a bit of fun, to see how well an amateur can do, so go and watch the film and answer me a few questions.\n\n1. What was your first thought, right after you watched the film?\n\nI enjoyed the style of the film, the way the director told me to look at the film. It was the first time I felt so relaxed looking at a film.\n\n2. How was the film made? Who was the scriptwriter? The director?\n\nI was the scriptwriter and the director.\n\n3. Who is the film based from?\n\nThe film was inspired from the short story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\n4. What is your favorite scene in the movie? What scene was the most hard to shoot (no matter how good it is)?\n\nThe last shot was my favorite. It was the hardest shot to do, because I shot it at night and the lighting wasn\u2019t enough to make an amazing reflection on the water.\n\n5. Who is your favorite actor? Why?\n\nI loved all of the actors in the movie except for my wife.\n\n6. How many more times do you wish that the same director made the film?\n\nI\u2019d like to see the film again. It is too long and I wouldn\u2019t want to see it once more, because it is over.\n\n7. How would you rate the acting in the film?\n\nPerfect acting. Every actor made it perfectly.\n\n8. Which director would you like to compare to?\n\nI\u2019d like to compare it to my own film.\n\n9. How did you like the setting of the film?\n\nI was happy that the film was set in New York.\n\n10. Were you able to identify all shots in it?\n\nYes, everything in the film was easy to identify and understand.\n\n10 minutes of talking and reading all the answers. So simple I can do it.\n\n1. What was your first thought, right after you watched the film?\n\nIt was a good movie.\n\n2. How was the film made? Who was the scriptwriter? The director?\n\nBoth. I wrote the original script and I directed it.\n\n3. What is your favorite scene in the movie? What scene was the most hard to shoot (no matter how good it is)?\n\nI liked the last shot.\n\n4. Who is your favorite actor? Why?\n\nI liked all of them. The girl played a great role in the film.\n\n5. How would you rate the acting in the film?\n\nExcellent acting in a good movie.\n\n6. Which director would you like to compare to?\n\nI liked all the directors I have seen making movies.\n\n7. How did you like the setting of the film?\n\nI liked the setting because of the cinematography.\n\n8. Were you able to identify all shots in it?\n\nYes. I did it to see if someone was trying to manipulate me.\n\n9. Which actress is most similar to the lead of the film? Why?\n\nIt was a girl with purple hair. She was similar looking.\n\n10. Are you a student or not?\n\nNot really. I am just a fan of film and some people can recognize me in public because of that.\n\n10 minutes of talking and reading the answers. Can you do it?\n\nIt\u2019s a short film. I can do it in 10 minutes.\n\nThe first movie ever made by a director\n\nSo you made your first movie?\n\nYes and it\u2019s called \u201cThe Murder of Helen Keller\u201d.\n\n1.

{"text": "\"The conversation around equality and representation has never been stronger,\" said Rep. Gia Resnick (D-Santa Monica), a supporter of the bill.\n\n\"In every region, communities are coming together.\"\n\nBut the bill is expected to face its share of opposition. Several groups \u2014 including the California Restaurant Assn. and the California Medical Assn. \u2014 have already come out against a similar bill last year that never made it out of committee.\n\n\"We are concerned that this bill ignores the reality of how women actually experience sexual harassment in the workplace,\" the restaurant group said in its statement.\n\n\"It is time to put an end to this discrimination.\"\n\nAnd for every group that supports this bill, there will be at least one group that opposes it \u2014 especially for the Hollywood community, which is currently reeling from a sexual harassment and misconduct scandal.\n\n\"When a man has power over you, it's a violation of the social contract and this bill would codify that,\" said Laura Bela-Hernandez, a producer and writer. \"It's important, right now, to get ahead of this problem instead of waiting for someone else to do it.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Capitol Resource Institute, a public policy advocacy group based in Sacramento, had no immediate comment on the proposal Saturday.\n\nMore than a dozen women have accused top producers, including Harvey Weinstein, on his Miramax, The Weinstein Co. and The Weinstein Co. slate of sexual harassment and misconduct. The scandal has also included accusations of sexual impropriety against other prominent figures, including producer-director James Toback, director Brett Ratner and director Ryan Murphy.\n\nIn the past few months, the hashtag #metoo has been used more than a half billion times to describe people sharing stories of abuse.\n\nIn California, there have been many proposed bills over the past few months to address sexual violence and harassment in the workplace. Among them:\n\nIn October, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a slate of bills that included one dealing with sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\nThe law expanded the definition of harassment, and added a provision to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act that bars retaliation against employees who refuse to engage in unwanted sexual conduct.\n\nFor the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace can include \"hostile work environment\" claims.\n\nSome of those laws passed in 2016 and are now in place. The law also requires more sexual harassment training for employees and employers.\n\n\"The passage of this law is going to make a huge impact,\" said Barbara Rooks, legislative advocate for the National Organization for Women.\n\nThe new law also included a provision that required some schools to provide \"affirmative consent\" by students before they can be sexual partners with each other \u2014 which was the topic of a heated floor debate in April.\n\nThat law was ultimately signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in May. Brown said students who want to engage in sexual relationships have to be clear about what they want and give their full consent and that they are \"unambiguously\" aware of the situation.\n\n\"Affirmative consent should replace ignorance of what consent looks like and is communicated as, as the standard of conduct for the people in a relationship,\" Brown said back in May at the capitol. \"We expect that people that are in a relationship know that behavior and are able to communicate 'Yes.' They know what consent looks like. That is the baseline.\"\n\nThe bill for the new legislation, however, had been introduced several times in 2016 and 2017 without going to the floor. And in April 2018, a Democrat from Santa Clara, Sen. Jeff Stone, called for it to be shelved.\n\n\"I am not in favor of this bill,\" Stone told the Washington Post. \"People should have their own free will to say 'Yes.' To have that forced just adds another element of stress to a student.\"\n\nThere are two other bills on their way to the state Capitol this year in an effort to deal with sexual assault and other sexual misconduct allegations at the college level.\n\nIn September, a bill was introduced to make those campuses safer. It would set higher reporting time frames and provide student support for \"sexual misconduct\" complaints.\n\nIn a recent Associated Press report, college administrators said that many schools already had procedures in place to handle sexual misconduct. They also said they did not have a way to collect data on sexual misconduct in the schools that don't already have tracking programs.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the colleges are doing a bad job, but I think their existing data collection is not robust enough,\" California Secretary of Education Tom Torlakson told Associated Press.\n\nThe bill is being spearheaded by four state senators: Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens; Connie Leyva, D-Chino; Bill Monning, D-Carmel; and Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg.", "label": 1, "id": 100509}

The reason, according to some Delhi politicians: a recent government education campaign about the dangers of oral sex has failed to make headway with the country\u2019s youth, which is dominated by a group that, for centuries, has been loath to talk about oral sex.\n\n\u201cWe have our own culture,\u201d said Jai Prakash Agarwal, who with his wife, Asha Sharma, is at the centre of the anti-acid-attack movement. \u201cWe don\u2019t think people should have sex before marriage.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s marriage customs have been criticised throughout the 20th century. In the 1940s, the anthropologist V.S.Naipaul wrote: \u201cMarriage is the only truly monogamous institution. All the others, from the polygamous family to the \u2018sacred prostitution\u2019 of the bhangra dancers, are adulteries of one sort or another\u201d. In more modern times, activists have blamed dowry demands for much of the country\u2019s high rate of infant mortality. \u201cIndia has one of the highest fertility rate in the world,\u201d says Dr Ramachandra Guha, a historian and the author of \u201cTata: The Marrying Kind\u201c. \u201cBut if the marriage rate could go up \u2014 then it is clear there is a huge amount of potential fertility, and we simply haven\u2019t tapped this. In these villages, nobody ever talks about family planning.\u201d\n\nMr Agarwal would not tell me how many acid attacks he suffered, but the number is alarming. \u201cIt went through the roof when it was on the front page,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2012, the Delhi High Court asked him to become a member of the All India Public Gathas (Aipg), a voluntary organisation created in 2001 \u201cwith the sole purpose of safeguarding the moral and social values of our society\u201d. It began with a few hundred people. As the organisation grew, it organised awareness sessions; and, in November 2012, it produced a \u201cPoster Campaign on the Dangers of Acid Attacks\u201c. (The next year, the High Court was again critical of the Aipg\u2019s work, after the Aipg refused to include an anti-rape message, from the government of Uttar Pradesh, as part its poster campaign; a poster that the High Court ruled \u201cmay act as a powerful antidote to the culture of sexual assault\u201c.)\n\nOn October 12th, Ms Sharma and 11 other members of the Aipg went to the Delhi University to speak. \u201cThese boys think our culture is archaic,\u201d says a man who answered the door at Sharma\u2019s flat (a young woman and a young child were inside). \u201cIt is not. The culture has been violated. The girl must be brought back.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of acid attacks has increased nearly seven-fold from 2009 to 2012. Figures for 2013 are just being calculated, but they expect to approach 3,700 cases. In New Delhi, the incidence of attack rose from eight in 2009 to more than 3,400 in 2012.\n\nThe Aipg\u2019s poster campaign had two main points: warning against unprotected sex and the danger, in the city, of acid attacks. The campaigns took place in at least 16 cities, including the state of Uttarakhand, the state of Mizoram, the city of Meerut and the town of Ludhiana. It was most successful in the north-western state of Punjab and the northern city of Guwahati. But according to some academics in India and abroad, it seems to have had little success.\n\nThere is, they say, a lot of ignorance about oral sex. And when there is ignorance, women suffer.\n\nAccording to Dr Dhananjay Mahapatra, an anthropologist who founded the Women and Child Development Unit at Ranchi University, when it comes to attitudes towards sex and sex education in India, \u201csex is very much tied with marriage. In the west, we are more open about sex, and more open about sexuality.\u201d Women might be more used to talking about sex education and the subject of oral-genital contact than Indian women, he said, in part due to the prevalence of dowry demands among India\u2019s poor. Many women must pay their fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents for a house and, with the hope that this will help them marry off their daughter, do not dare to think about oral sex. \u201cIf they raise that concern, they are told: \u2018Get her raped.\u2019", "label": 1, "id": 100512}
{"text": "Craig Steven Wright is one of the most peculiar characters in the history of crypto.\n\nA man with a curious history, he has had several names in his life, including Kimoto Craig, Wright Craig and Criag Wright and is even believed by some to be an impostor with false memories and no legitimate claim to a name.\n\nYet on the crypto subreddit r/Ethtrader he was once one of the most well known traders in the bitcoin universe, with at one time boasting 1.5M followers on Twitter. Wright has a Twitter account, with thousands of followers and his posts get thousands of likes and retweets. That\u2019s largely thanks to his unique trading style.\n\nWright\u2019s trading style is best compared to a kind of hybrid between a traditional futures trader, and a market maker using algorithms. He uses a few proprietary algorithms that help him spot when to buy and when to sell, and he trades across multiple markets and exchanges.\n\nBut how did a professional trader such as Wright end up starting so many bitcoin podcasts and being the CEO of bitcoin trading firm Bitcoin Education Services? The answer to this question is surprisingly simple. After being laid off from his job and not having any savings he decided to learn how to become a more successful trader.\n\nWright\u2019s history in the tech world started at the age of 12, when he was introduced to trading on the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Cex.io, which was founded by the Winklevoss twins, who went on to create one of the early bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWright, who was then 13 at the time, had little luck with Cex.io and was largely just a lurker in the community. However, Wright became more interested in the space in after watching a COO get arrested for fraud and later being hired by Blockbuster as an intern at the age of 16. Wright also helped develop a crypto game and blockchain project at the age of 18 with fellow MIT students.\n\nHe took jobs at startups and worked on a bitcoin-focused start-up at the age of 18, but after finding the start-up\u2019s product was never going to be released he decided to focus entirely on trading. At the age of 21, Wright was one of the most successful traders at his school and also won trading competitions around the world.\n\nBy the age of 22, he was already teaching at a trading school, the College of Trading, and in 2013 Wright left the U.S. to move to Tokyo where he enrolled at the prestigious Hitotsubashi University, earning a degree in business and commerce.\n\nBut by this stage Wright had already left the University to begin trading full-time at 23 after his uncle, who had become a trader himself, suggested it to him as he did not yet have the licenses to operate a fully regulated brokerage house in Japan. In 2014, Wright and another uncle started Wright Brothers, an international bitcoin brokerage that helped clients trade on multiple exchanges. While Wright Brothers is now defunct, it was one of the earliest and largest international brokering houses on the market.\n\nHowever, Wright Brothers started to go under when it was revealed that Wright had been a fraudulent operator, with a number of users coming forward to state that their accounts had been used to pay for Wright\u2019s own personal spending.\n\nIn an interview with the Bitcoinist in 2014, Wright admitted that Wright Brothers ran up bills for thousands of dollars in a single day.\n\nWright Brothers was eventually shut down by the Japanese government and Wright was ordered to pay $6,000,000.\n\nWright was eventually found by a federal investigator, who asked him to prove that he owned all of the stolen funds, which is when he contacted CoinIdol, a sister site of the CoinDesk, to tell us his fascinating story. During the interview, Wright provided a number of additional details that have never been revealed before.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing has been going on for a long time,\u201d Wright told Coinidol. \u201cI\u2019m basically a fraudster, but a bit of a good one.\u201d Wright said. \u201cThe $6 million in my bank account, the money that the FBI wanted was my money, but I didn\u2019t actually make it. I\u2019ve had all that time to spend, to think about it, to write books, to write articles, and it\u2019s not really that much.\u201d\n\nWright has published many books and online projects, many of them on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but what do you really need to understand the story of Wright? Well, I think this should be enough to start you off.\n\nA tale of two coins\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created the first ever, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency in 2008, what was he actually setting in motion?

{"text": "background and objectives : the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of low-grade salivary gland neoplasms (LGNs) in a population-based setting and to determine the clinical significance of LGNs and the optimal method of clinical detection.\n\ndesign: retrospective cohort study.\n\nsubjects: the files of 1,062 non-AIDS patients (821 men, 241 women), aged 20\u201389 years, hospitalized at a single medical center from January 2005 to October 2007 were reviewed. Sex and age distribution, tumor site and histologic subtype, stage and survival rate were registered.\n\nresults: among 1,062 patients, there were 534 HIV-positive (M:F, 37:1), including four patients with LGNs (0.4%), who did not differ in terms of sex or age from those without LGNs (M:F, 0.7%: p = 0.3, aged 55.7 \u00b1 15.0 vs 55.4 \u00b1 13.1 years respectively; p = 0.8), but they had a lower rate of alcohol addiction (10% vs 33.7%; P = 0.002). LGNs were identified at a higher rate in the HIV-infected group than in the group without HIV (0.3% vs 0%, p = 0.009), in those taking antiretroviral drugs (0.3% vs 0%, p = 0.009), and in those who had detectable plasma HIV RNA levels of above 1000 copies/ml (0.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.04). None of the patients with LGNs was human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I-positive. A subset of patients had no other relevant disease (M:F, 1:1), which was more commonly identified in the HIV-positive group than in the group without HIV (33.3% vs 10.5%; p<0.001). After controlling for other co-variables, HIV infection remained significantly associated with the occurrence of LGNs. The overall 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with LGNs than in those without them (p<0.005). LGNs occurred in about 10 times more often in HIV-infected than uninfected individuals aged 40 and over.\n\nconclusion: a relatively high but acceptable prevalence of LGNs, which occurs in a subset of patients without other associated illness, was found in this population-based setting. These tumors show an unexpected association with HIV infection and a worse survival outcome.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLow-grade salivary gland neoplasms (LGNs)\nare rare, benign mesenchymal tumor that can occur as solitary or multiple salivary gland masses.1\u20137 Although a majority of LGNs is associated with autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders, the rest lack any apparent etiology.7,8 LGNs are well known to be premalignant or precancerous entities and have been frequently associated with development of multiple myeloma, as noted in a case published in 19878 (see Table 6).8 However, because the majority of cases are detected incidentally and without associated systemic manifestations, the clinical significance of solitary LGNs remains controversial. Only 14 published cases of HIV-related LGNs have been reported thus far.\n\nThe prevalence of salivary glands tumors in general populations is unknown, although several retrospective studies have assessed frequency of salivary gland neoplasms, mostly parotid gland tumors, in patients with established HIV infection.9\u201312 To our knowledge, only three other reports on LGNs in patients with established HIV infection were published.13\u201315 According to data from SEER (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1973\u20131998), in the United States a relatively low prevalence of this tumor (0.3%) was found by using cancer-specific SEER data. To date, there is a paucity of data on LGNs in a population-based setting.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of LGNs and the relationship with HIV infection and other non-HIV-associated illnesses in a community-based setting.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe Files of 1,062 Non-AIDS Patients hospitalized at the D\u2019Amicis Hospital, Palermo, Italy, and at the San Martino Hospital, Novara, Italy, from January 2005 to October 2007 were reviewed retrospectively (see Table 1). The study was approved by the local institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The patients\u2019 sex and age as well as tumor site and histological subtype, stage and survival rate were registered.

{"text": "Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a local level. How much progress have women made?\n\nAhead of International Women\u2019s Day (IWD), here are some facts about global gender inequality from the World Bank Institute that may surprise you.\n\n1. Global inequality is more unequally shared between women and men than between countries, for instance, in terms of women/men life expectancy ratios.\n\n2. Of the nearly 20 million girls (aged 10-19) out of school globally, one third live in sub-Saharan Africa and around 10% in western Europe and North America.\n\n3. The total number of women participating in formal labour markets has been increasing but the \u2018global gender gap\u2019 remains in the range 3:1 or 4:1, i.e. a higher number of women in low-skilled jobs.\n\n4. In 2017, the estimated gap between male and female earnings in the workforce was around USD 1,300 on average.\n\n5. In the last 20 years, women in the least industrialised countries now earn an average of USD 7.3% less than male workers, the latest available figures suggest.\n\nBut as the picture is more localised, in any specific country, income inequality is greater between gender or caste than within gender or caste, for instance, an estimated 10 to 20 percentage points for rural vs. urban and around 30 to 50 percentages points for tribal versus other ethnic groups.\n\n6. In developed countries like the US, inequality is most pronounced for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics.\n\nFor instance, for Black and Hispanic men, the ratio of median income of men to the average income of women is 14:1 compared to a ratio of 9 and 3:1 respectively for White and Asian men and women. Similarly, the White/non-Hispanic gap in median male/female income is 23 to 10 percentage points than the Latino/Hispanic gap of 60 to 40 percentage points.\n\n7. Global household inequality across wealth quintiles is far greater than inequality by ethnicity. Inequality by ethnicity is higher than inequality by gender or country.\n\n8. For wealthy North American women in 2017, the median wealth was $29,200 but for men it was $1.2m. And globally, women and men in wealthier countries had similar median (mean) household wealth: in the US, at $91,400; UK at $81,400; Germany $68,000; Switzerland, $57,400.\n\n9. Overall, gender inequality appears to be greater in countries with greater economic inequity between people of different race/ethnicity, as, for instance, in North America.\n\n10. In North America, people of colour tend to live in the poorest areas where they are less likely to have the resources to move into the middle class. The overall income inequalities in North America, at 9.2:1, were higher even than between countries, i.e. in Germany (4.7:1), Japan (3.5:1), South Korea (4:1) and Switzerland (3:1), where income inequalities between gender or ethnicity are less pronounced.\n\n11. Within any country, within regions including gender, race/ethnicity and caste or occupation, for instance, the poor are likely to be women, rural, not highly educated, not employed in agriculture or in services (i.e. mostly women and people of colour).\n\nAnd within any country or region or occupation, for instance, male doctors are more likely to be men but most women in rural Africa and India are farmers.\n\nIn some regions, like the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the gender gap is closing for the better educated while women still lag behind even more disadvantaged men in the poorest states.\n\n12. Women in Europe are also disadvantaged or have similar (or even slightly higher) inequalities than men. For example, in France, the gap in employment pay between men and women in 2017 was around 5.3 to 1, the same as in Greece or Russia.\n\nIn 2017, the highest proportion of men employed in the informal sector of economies worldwide was found in the US (48%) and in the UK (25%), while women\u2019s share of employment in informal activities is highest in Turkey (62%).\n\n13. The share of women in the highest skilled categories, i.e. STEM, has remained flat globally and is on average at 22%, the same as in India, Vietnam and China.\n\n14. The share of women in low skilled/low income work is around half that of men (50-60% vs. 20-30%) in North and Latin America in developed countries, in the Middle East and North Africa and most countries in Southern sub-Saharan Africa, a reflection of women\u2019s overrepresentation in lower skilled/lower income occupations.\n\n15.

{"text": "{ fn new(name: &str) -> Self; fn do_something(&self) {... } fn main() { let mut handler = Handler::new(); handler = Handler::new(_name = \"the Name\"); handler }\n\nThis line should be familiar to you from the previous articles, but you might not be familiar with everything it does.\n\nThe new function returns the struct to the Handler.handler variable. So, once the do_something function is done it has a value you can use in Handler.main.\n\nThere is a function called with that we can pass to the Handler struct. That function is also called with &mut Handler.main. And finally, there is a let declaration at the end to assign the name value to the newly declared variables that will be used throughout the program.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot going on there. I won\u2019t go too deep into types, for now, you should just be aware that the types of things don\u2019t matter when using the borrow checker. It needs some kind of data to run off of, and using pointers is just fine for that.\n\nOk, what else?\n\nAll right! So, this code snippet was super long and it didn\u2019t really tell you what the Handler does. That can change your life because if you\u2019re familiar with rust, you can actually just take that entire struct and implement the methods on it. That\u2019s called \u201cborrowing.\u201d\n\nBut, to do that, we actually have to look at how and why the borrow checker is so great. And, that means getting into some kind of deeper understanding of where borrow checker came into being, right?\n\nWell, let me tell you\u2026\n\nFor an in-depth look at this, check out: Understanding the Rust Borrow Checker, Part II: Rustc Borrow Checker is Real Time | Part II: How the Rustc Borrow Checker Work\n\nI\u2019m not going to go too in-depth in this article, because I plan on doing several other articles in the Future Rust Series. I want this to be the last article just to cover the basics of the borrow checker and Rustc. And, besides, I\u2019ve shown you enough of how the borrow checker is implemented by going into super detail about the borrow rules!\n\nI hope this helps and this article was informative for you!\n\nIf you were following along, you should have everything you need to create a full working application at the end of this article.

If true, this would confirm predictions of the dynamical model based on the Milky Way structure for the formation of the Centaurus group (@kroupa:1991). An extended discussion of this result is given in the paper by @kranich:2003.\n\nThe main difference of our method compared to those in other articles which use the method of @debattista:2002 is that we try to solve for a 3D model in general, and not only when the stellar system is assumed to be in dynamical equilibrium with the central potential of the dark matter potential. The advantage of our model is that we can test the dynamical stability of the system. We are able to quantify the effect of changing the number of orbital periods on the stability of the system for an example parameter space. The results agree well with predictions from the stability arguments based on @merritt:1999.\n\nThe structure we derived for Centaurus A is in agreement with previous results such as N-body models of @binney:1984, and self-consistent models of the Centaurus Cluster presented in @bekki:2002. It would be very interesting to apply our model to other clusters. We are able to calculate the mass of the system simply by comparing the projected mass along the line of sight with the total mass of the system. The results show that, while Centaurus A is a well-determined system from a kinematic point of view, there is a significant amount of mass outside the observed velocity field that must be modeled in order to improve the overall fit in the radial mass distribution.\n\nThe work presented in this paper is part of the PhD work of @pfenniger:2005 at the University of Cologne.

Each silicon wafer contains at least 100 (and usually 2000) parallel channels with \u223c50-nm gaps that function as micropores and as channels in the fabrication process. The channels were microfabricated by three key process steps: pre-fabricated mold, laser patterning, and etching.

In the laser patterning step, we applied a femtosecond laser to pattern a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) block. In our fabrication process, a PDMS mold with \u223c1 \u00b5m wide and \u223c50 \u00b5m long patterns was first fabricated using the SU-8 as substrate by a UV-based photolithography process. The SU-8 mold was then used as the substrate in the following laser patterning process. Under the condition of an optimum femtosecond laser power, we obtained a patterned PDMS block containing submicron channels with a constant 50-nm gap and \u223c50 \u00b5m width. Then, the PDMS block was carefully released from the SU-8 mold by the release agent of OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane). The PDMS block contained features of submicrometer to several micrometer sizes. The PDMS block was bonded and sealed to a new, untreated, silicon wafer. Then, the PDMS block was peeled off from the SU-8 mold and the bonded PDMS block was baked to remove any OTS solution that remained on the SiO2 surface. In the etching step, channels were formed in silicon by etching the silicon wafer, and the PDMS block was finally bonded to the etched silicon wafer.\n\nTo show the suitability of our device for PCR-based detection methods, we determined the binding capacity of the fabricated device by measuring the number of particles (50- to 100-\u00b5m in diameter) that can be trapped in the fabricated device. The results showed that the fabricated device had a binding capacity of \u223c3\u00d7106 particles ([Fig. 1B](#fig_001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Next, we determined the efficiency of virus purification using the fabricated device. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) virions, a typical enveloped DNA virus, and human polyomavirus *sim* (HPyV *sim*), a naked DNA virus, were used as test viruses and their purifications were performed in a volume of 250 \u00b5L and in a time of 15 min. First, 10 \u00b5L of the purified virus/plasma mixture were added to 8 \u00b5L of each virus diluted by ddH~2~O (1:5) and the viruses were captured in the fabricated device. Then, the captured viruses were eluted by adding 250 \u00b5L of the PCR buffer. The eluted viruses were then applied to 3% agarose gel in phosphate-buffered saline containing ethidium bromide. By visual inspection, the purified virus mixture showed clear bands corresponding to the expected size of each purified virus ([Fig. 1Ba, c, e](#fig_001a){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Also, the purified virus mixture was confirmed by PCR after purification using the fabricated device ([Fig. 1C](#fig_001a){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nNext, we determined the minimum sample volume and detection limit of the fabricated device. For this purpose, Hepatitis C virus-specific antigen (HCV-Ag) was used as the sample and purified by the fabricated device as mentioned in Methods. The purified HCV-Ag was diluted in a volume to 5% of the total viral sample, and the samples were then applied to the fabricated device ([Fig. 1D](#fig_001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). A 5-\u00b5L sample was loaded to the fabricated device and eluted in the same volume as the input sample. The eluted and the loaded volume were then used as the input and the eluted volume, respectively. The detection limit of the fabricated device was determined from the titration of the virus concentration in the input sample as 5 \u00d7 10^3^ particles/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 5 \u00d7 10^2^ particles/mL.\n\nTo show the stability and the capability of PCR as an amplification technique in our developed device, we tested the performance of the fabricated device and a silicon", "label": 1, "id": 100521}

The mobile handset maker has planned to launch a series of Jio promotional offers to be linked to smart phone customers, starting with the \u2018Bharat Swabhishek\u2019 or \u2018Swachh Bharat\u2019 initiative. \u201cJio\u2019s vision is to provide India a world-class connectivity solutions for the emerging internet lifestyle. At Jio, connectivity is key and at the heart of its vision to connect is the key product called JioPhone,\u201d Arvind Gupta, Managing Director, Intex Technologies told IANS.\n\nThe JioPhone will be part of the Rs. 494 million (approx. $7.5 million) Intex plan unveiled in September last year. It is scheduled to be available in the fourth quarter of the current financial year.\n\n\u201cA JioPhone has become a symbol of Jio. There are more than 4 million Jios connected to different ecosystems at the moment. The JioPhone is the best of its kind, the very first smartphone from a reputed company which can act as a modem to connect to any ecosystem, any network, anywhere in India or around the world,\u201d Arvind Gupta said.\n\n\u201cA JioPhone is a milestone for Intex too. The company has been in hardware business for 30 years and it is also building a strong service centre business with more than 5,000 retail outlets. And, today, we have come up to a different point with an idea of integrating JioPhone and our retail infrastructure. With this, our company and Intex is set to become a different brand,\u201d he added.\n\nThe JioPhone will be available through about 3,000 retail outlets, including JioMart stores across India and Intex.\n\nJio has already completed testing JioPhone with the telecom operator through which they worked on the performance of the handset. The JioPhone is expected to be the highest-ever selling smart phone in India in 2016 with more than a million launches, Gupta said.\n\n\u201cThis year, we believe the JioPhone will become the most popular choice in the country,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cJioPhone is the best of its kind, the very first smartphone from a reputed company which can act as a modem to connect to any ecosystem, any network, anywhere in India or around the world,\u201d Arvind Gupta.\n\nThis is the first time that a phone with a built-in modem is being put to be used only by Jio subscribers as the company is only open to sell the device directly to Jio subscribers, who will be first to use the JioPhone. The device will, however, be made available to other mobile operators in the coming months, he said.\n\nJioPhone is a new category smartphone that is being unveiled for the first time by Intex in India, Gupta noted.\n\n\u201cJioPhone is not being developed by Intex. Jio will be first to launch it, then market it, and then sell it across the country along with their 4G service called Jio4G, which is still under test, will be launched in 2017,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe are going to launch JioPhone and Jio4G together as Jio wants to become the first mover and first to launch the country, then to run it across the country,\u201d Intex Technologies Vice President (Business Strategy) Pritiraj Bose told IANS.\n\nThe smartphone will sell for just Rs. 509 ($7.45) which is a discount of Rs. 100 and a maximum of up to Rs. 2,999 (approx. $43.60) on payment of Rs. 7,999 ($117.70) for JioPhone. This is Rs. 450 lesser than the price of iPhone 6 ($650 in the US or 4,999 rupees at current exchange rates) and iPhone 6 Plus ($740).\n\n\u201cThe lower cost will give a major boost to the phone. The cost will go down further after the roll out of Jio4G\u201d said Bose.\n\nIntex is looking to expand in the mid-tier smart phone segment and will be launching low-cost smartphones after its launch of a new brand called GionX. Under the GionX, Intex will offer low-cost feature phones from just Rs. 999 for a variety of plans for basic, popular and advanced features.\n\n\u201cWe will launch GionX in the coming months and then focus on smartphones. JioPhone can be the first launch, as we already have the manufacturing capability with the launch of GionX\u201d, said Bose", "label": 1, "id": 100522}
{"text": "This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the mid '30s about a boy orphaned during a war, who finds a home at the old hotel, which has been abandoned since before the war. The owner, a cranky old lady named Mrs. Tilton (Mary Pickford), sees the boy as a burden. Meanwhile, various people come to stay at the hotel, one of them a sadistic soldier who has no place to go (Robert Cummings). This story is a little slow and predictable until the last 10 minutes, when the boy finds out that he has an older brother who was killed in the war and is buried in France. From then on things pick up. This is a must see. It has the advantage of being made before World War II (so everyone is the age they are supposed to be), and the music is very good. This was director Jack Conway's only feature. It seems that he had other things he wanted to do and left the project. This is probably an even better movie for young children than it was for adults. It is certainly more of a kids movie than other movies of its age. The music is good, and the sets are good. I don't like the ending of this movie, though. I would have liked to have seen it all the way through. This movie came out in late December of 1935 and is available on video.\n\nThis is a weird one. Set in Europe before World War II, the action revolves around a woman, Maria, who meets a blind violinist who is working as a laborer for some local peasants. He falls in love with her and then kills himself, which she finds out about. The peasants blame her for his death, so she runs away into the mountains. Eventually a young German army officer helps her escape from the peasants' vengeance. It's basically a retelling of Cinderella. The action is kind of slow moving, the story is pretty typical for the time, and the characters are kind of stereotypical. The best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) thing about the movie is the score. The score was composed by Franz Waxman, who later became famous for his scores for the \"Casablanca\", \"Meet Me in St. Louis\", and \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" films. He also wrote a song (\"Love Is Strange\") that is in the movie.\n\nThis is a very romantic movie. It was directed by Victor Sjostrom and starred Greta Garbo and Emil Jannings.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, goes like this: the hero - a young Swedish man (Emil Jannings) and his fiance - a beautiful girl (Greta Garbo) who is engaged to a much older, rich man - is working on his own father's farm, the home of his fiance, when a young woman with a very old face and gray hair and a girl of about 19 appear on the scene and ask for shelter and food. He agrees to let them stay, but is surprised when the young woman tells him who she is and he seems to believe her. They spend some time together at the farm, where he meets her daughter and where he first meets the fiance as she comes to visit his father. But her daughter tells them about the fiance, and as the fiance has been very rude to the young man's fiance and the fiance is now jealous of the daughter - especially after hearing she's going to marry the older man - the fiance is ready to kill everyone who gets in the way of his own plans. The girl leads him to a hidden cellar where her father and his friend are living in a cellar in a cave. On the way there, the fiance, the girl and her fiance's father get into a fight but he kills the man he thinks is his father and throws him to a river and then kills the girl's fiance who he thinks is there. Then he leaves. The girl - her daughter - helps the poor people at the farm and later meets young man as she is leaving with her daughter and they walk home together to the fiance's house. As they are walking, he sees his fiance in the distance and goes after her. She is not happy to see him, as she's mad he didn't believe his father was actually alive as the girl in the forest told them, and he doesn't believe her because he has another daughter, not the one she told him about earlier. But they do believe each other when they talk and then they kiss and she asks him to marry her and they go away together.\n\nThis is a beautiful movie, and it was made in 1937.\n\nThis is a fun movie, made in 1937. It is set in the mid-1800s in Germany, during the beginning of the industrial revolution.

And it's bad for the lungs, like tobacco. But unlike tobacco, it's a cheap drug that has been used as a recreational drug throughout time and is legal in many countries. Some claim it can treat many medical conditions, from ADHD to depression and pain. But can't it be harmful as well as good?\n\nThe authors of this book explain the science behind marijuana. They cover its history, what makes it different and similar to other recreational drugs, its benefits and risks, and how it can affect the human nervous system. They address questions like: What is the difference between marijuana and cannabinoids? What is marijuana's risk for dependence?\n\nWhat is the science behind marijuana? Where did the word \"weed\" come from? The first known record of smoking cannabis was discovered as early as the sixth century BC in China. The word \"marijuana\" originated as \"mari' a name used in the ancient Maya language for the \"sacred drug\" that was used during certain rituals. In 1406 the Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes was the first European to use the term marijuana. The word marijuana came from the word for this \"new, powerful, intoxicant substance\".\n\nThe drug was introduced to Spain in 1532 by Hernan Cortes (1485-1547) when he brought the plants to Mexico. The Spanish crown prohibited the new intoxicant in 1605. Marijuana was reintroduced to Great Britain in 1629. It became an illegal drug in 1835. Some countries continue to ban marijuana: The United States, Australia, Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Sudan. In some countries it became legal: The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Scotland, Ireland, Finland, Switzerland, Norway and Greece.\n\nThe first botanical and medical use of marijuana dates to ancient China. Marijuana became a source of income and pleasure for the Chinese. It was used for a number of medical purposes, and also became sacred to some Chinese peoples. In the eleventh century, marijuana was introduced to Mexico. In the early colonial period, marijuana was used in many cultures, from Europe to South America. Many civilizations around the world cultivated marijuana for its uses. In the ancient Mayas and Aztecs, and the Incas, it was used primarily as a narcotic or recreational substance.\n\nWhen Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes introduced marijuana to the Americas, he named this new intoxicant after this new \u201cnew powerful drug.\u201d The word marijuana was created from the Mayan/Toltec root. The \u2018mara\u2019 in \u2018maya\u2019 is the word for a drug that was taken during sacred ceremonies. The \u2018manna\u2019 in Marijuana means \"strength\" or \"power\u201d. The word marijuana came from the Mayan word \u201cmara:man\u201d meaning \u201cto kill\u201d and \u201cman:ana\u201d meaning \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cmara:man\u201c. the word marijuana was first used in 1428 by the Spaniard and Conquistador, Hernan Cortes, who wrote a letter to the Spanish king, and used the word a few times in his letter, to refer to an \"intoxicating drug\", he also introduced the name \u201cmarijuana\u201d in New Spain, to what later became Mexico. Hernan Cortes named this \"new intoxicating drug\", which he brought from the \"East Indies\" in his letter to the king of Spain in 1428, \u201cmari' \u201d [the Mayan word for a sacred drug that is used in rituals].\n\nCannabis (the chemical name is cannabinol), is considered by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be a drug which is used to treat specific conditions including \u201cgout", "label": 1, "id": 100524}

{"text": "However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching him as a radical democrat and a transcendentalist and many of his political writings were inspired by transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nWhile his book Civil Disobedience is a collection of essays written by Thoreau over the course of his career it is the first, most famous, and least scholarly of these essays that is considered to be his classic and is a primary source to this day. In the essay, Thoreau declares that the state can legitimately exist only so long as it guarantees rights to a man's person and property. It can not legitimately compel its citizens to do things outside of their personal or economic interest. His ideas are in opposition to that of the state and a form of civil disobedience. Thoreau did not like the way people were treated by the state and he refused to take its money. This led to a criminal conviction for his refusal.\n\nThoreau believed in and practiced what is called laissez-faire economics. He said, \"Economics for the most part is a dismal science. It teaches that man can thrive only in association with one, or at most, two other entities; that he is dependent upon one or two other living beings; that the one entity or the two entities, that is, human association, are his masters; and that therefore this association is the natural and normal and only one, namely, nature. It is a science that has made us free, but it has almost made a slave of us.\" In fact, many of the things ThOREAU said, I say.\n\nThe key word here is \"freedom\". He said, \"But what is there of us that is not a part of nature? Our thoughts, our affections, our instincts, our reason, our will, our powers of imagination, we have all of these in common with the other animals. It is true, we have somewhat special ones, I grant. But, what is more, they are all the creatures have; not one of them is possessed by another; they may all be, and often are, in conflict; they must sometimes give way to others whose powers are more superior to them; yet all that they may do, all the different things they may make for themselves, by the use which they see fit to put them to, is absolutely free and not in the slightest degree subject to an order of a higher nature, whether human or supermundane.\"\n\nIn \"Civil Disobedience\", Thoreau wrote, \"What we have once enjoyed we can not take away from others\". But the fact that some people are homeless, hungry, sick, jobless, and/or oppressed, is the way Thoreau and Thoreau's fellow transcendentalists felt that should be remedied.\n\n1. According to the World Wide Web, Thoreau supported the abolitionist movement and was involved in a number of antislavery meetings.\n\n2. A year before he died, Thoreau was charged with violation of a state law for refusing to pay his poll tax. In a famous example of civil disobedience, he was arrested for this infraction and jailed. Thoreau was eventually fined.\n\nA couple of months ago, my wife and I came across something called a \"solar oven\" while browsing the internet. Now I'm not an expert on the topic but I know enough to understand that a solar oven is something that cooks food by harnessing the power of the sun. So, naturally, I started doing some research into this thing.\n\nFirst, what is the function of a solar oven? Simply put, it's a cooking device that is powered by the sun's rays so it doesn't require electricity to function. According to one online resource, \"A solar oven may be used just like a conventional oven... except the sun is an infinite energy source, much like the heat of the sun in an oven on earth, the sun is infinite energy source that cooks food\". While a regular oven cooks food by using electricity, it is this function of a solar oven that it's \"off the grid system\" and uses the sun to cook using its power.\n\nSo how does a solar oven do this? I can only speak for what I understand. So let's say that you are baking something like pancakes. Normally to make that happen, you'd need an electric oven which requires 120v of electricity to function. However, if the solar oven is used, all it needs is the sun's rays to function. This means you can still cook and bake and cook pancakes and stuff without an electricity bill each month.\n\nI know most of you, particularly those who own your own home, are probably curious as to the quality of the solar oven I'm talking about. A quick check of its specs say that it outputs 500\u00b0F. This means that the solar oven must cook with a temperature of over 500\u00b0F to work. There", "label": 1, "id": 100526}
{"text": "physical geometry studies mutual disposition of geometrical objects and points, the\nsubject is included in geometry studies (which itself is included in\nmathematics studies).\nOne of the main difference between mathematics and geometry at this\nstage is that in mathematics the point (as an abstract) becomes merely a\nsymbol that represents the concept of zero and one, while in geometry\nits position is well defined by axioms of Euclid and this position is\ncorrelated with all other geometrical objects like lines, planes and\nspheres.\n\nAnother example of early studies of mathematics, which is a kind\nof geometry, is mathematics of astronomy that was conducted during the\nperiod of 4th century BC. In 4th century BC, mathematicians like\nAnaximandros (born about 370 BC) studied celestial motions or the\nlaws of motion of celestial bodies (i.e, the universe). They studied\ncelestial motions of the earth, moon and the Sun. But later in the\nhistory the focus was shifted to the calculation of the distances and\nobservation of the planets (which are more important than the laws of\nmotion of the celestial bodies). Therefore the major branch of\nmathematics called astronomy (or \"matho-physics\") came into existence.\n\nEuclid wrote the mathematical treatise called Elements in Alexandria\nthat is more than 2000 years old. It was the basis for further\ndevelopment of geometry. Euclid defined geometry by two fundamental\naxioms, axiom 1, the definition of a line and axiom 2, the definition of\nplane. He also gave the rules to obtain various other geometrical\nobjects like point, perpendicular line, circle, parallel and perpendicular\nlines, plane, line segment, triangle and many other. The other\ndefinitions and theorems of Euclid's Elements laid the foundations\nof modern geometry.\n\nIn spite of these developments, for some very important reasons,\nthere were no major developments of mathematical methods in the\nmathematics until the beginning of 20th century. (For example,\nno proper axiomatic approach existed.) And even then there was no\nsystematical development of the major branches of mathematics\nlike number theory or complex analysis. For instance, number\ntheory is a fundamental branch of mathematics and it was an\nimportant part of the studies of mathematics in late 19th\ncentury. But there was no proper axiomatic approach in the\ndevelopment of number theory.\n\nThere were few developments in the field of arithmetic\nfor some important historical reasons also. The main reason for\nthis was the major discovery of the fact that the traditional\narithmetic could not serve as a bridge to connect various\nbranches of mathematics. Therefore number theory which was to be\nmore extensive in its field could not progress.\n\nThe reason for\nnon-progression of the field even though there was a major\ndiscovery in number theory is that it was impossible to\ndiscover an elementary proof of the major theorem of\nnumber theory called (Goldbach's hypothesis).\n\nThere were no proper axiomatic systems and there was no\nmajor discovery in the field of analysis during the\nperiod of late 19th century.\n\nAxiomatic approach is a system in which certain rules,\nassumptions, and definitions are set forth in order to\nprove a body of knowledge. This is a basic method of\nmathematical research. There were some developments of\nsystematic approach in analysis and it is often stated\nthat \"the development was initiated by the development\nof axiomatic\". This is only part of the whole truth, which\nis that there was no proper development of the field. Anaximandros\nintroduced the theory of continuity but he could not justify it\nfrom an axiomatic point view. It is not possible to give a\nproper axiomatic system when we talk about continuity and\nlimits. (For example, how can we introduce the concept of\nlimit using axiomatic method.?) So the axiomatic development\nwas not carried out.\n\nAnother example of the non-axiomatic mathematical studies\nis that from the time of Pythagoras to the time of late 19th\ncentury there was no proper development of the axiomatic\nprocedure of proving the theorem of Pythagoras. (Mathematicians\nsuch as Gauss developed their own individual versions of\nproofs in some cases and some of them were able to prove\n\"Pythagorean theorem\" using proper proofs. But the\nmajority of these proofs were not acceptable from a\nmathematical point of view.)\n\nAnother important example in the history of mathematics is\nthat, despite the major developments in algebra by\nGalois and De La Valette, the development of abstract\nalgebra could not progress because of (i) the fact that there\nwas no proper ax", "label": 1, "id": 100527}

The existence of nontrivial magnetoelectric transition in the spin-orbit coupled topological insulator has been recently found by the authors in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The ground-state phase diagram at the electron density n=1 and a fixed Rashba spin-orbit coupling $\\alpha=0$ is studied. At fixed magnetic flux and electron density, the phase transition can be divided into four phases: metallic, Nambu metal, topological insulator and superconductor. We also determine the superconducting gap and the edge structure of the system in the proximity of the transition boundary. We note that the phase transition can be tuned by Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\n\nWe also study the effects of electron - electron interactions by using the random phase approximation (RPA). We find that the enhancement of the spin-induced charge imbalance by an external electric field leads to an additional phase transition from metallic to topological metallic phase with increasing electron interaction.\n\nFinally, we study the density dependence of the superconducting order parameter $\\Delta _{sc}$, the density - and spin-dependent effective Zeeman fields $H_{x}^{i}$ and $H_{y}^{i}$\u00a0at the transition line from metallic to topological superconductor, when $H=0$, in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We determine the density dependence of $\\Delta _{sc}$, $H_{x}^{i}$ and $H_{y}^{i}$ for n=0.1 and $H=0$, for two different strengths $U/W_{0}=0.1$ and 0.01.\n\nIn short, our study provides a comprehensive phase diagram for the spin-orbit coupled spinful topological insulator with spin-polarized superconductivity in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\n\n**Acknowledgments**.

{"text": "3rd UPDAT E 6:10 PM: NBC is wrapping its first night of the Olympics by announcing the live-TV ratings for Wednesday, July 23, 2012. NBC won in total viewers (19.6 million), but CBS (17.5 million) won in the demographic that matters for advertisers \u2014 the advertiser-friendly 25-54-year-olds (10.7 million). ABC (14.8 million) did third.\n\nThe last few days of NBC\u2019s Olympics have been a mixed bag for the Peacock \u2014 one of its worst nights of the Games has happened to be one of its most-watched on network TV (Wednesday, Wednesday). A re-run of Bob\u2019s Olympic hockey team, Saturday night\u2019s primetime had just 2.1 million viewers \u2014 with a 1.3 million peak \u2014 as well as 627,000 adults 18-49. It was the least-watched Olympics primetime among adults 18-49 since May 2005. Sunday\u2019s primetime had 2.1 million viewers and a 1.2 rating 18-49.\n\nNBC pulled no punches on Monday evening, going with the best story by a long shot: the drama surrounding a Russian athlete\u2019s positive drug test. During the opening ceremony, NBC took off its top three TV shows (including football, which was in reruns on the NBC OTA Network) and had the live telecast of swimmer Ryan Lochte winning gold for the United States in the 400 free (he\u2019d been fifth in prelims). That was a nice counter-programming idea. If that hadn\u2019t happened when they did, the telecast would have been a mess as Lochte ran under the water in the semifinals and then hit the deck as a result of a dive and was brought out by his teammates \u2014 there was a long commercial break during the last moment of that race. It\u2019s a great event that deserves that kind of exposure.\n\nAt 8, NBC\u2019s Sochi Olympics opening ceremonies \u2014 complete with a spectacular water show and some dramatic music \u2014 drew 31.5 million viewers, but that was 2 million viewers fewer than the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin \u2014 where NBC, which lost out in the bidding, had been a distant second. Also on Sunday afternoon, NBC did an hour of Olympics-related coverage, and it averaged 7.6 million viewers, and a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo. The Bob Costas primetime specials, however, had 10 million viewers and a 2.3/6 in the demo.\n\nThis was a strong 7.25 million live-plus-seven-day-evening viewership, with the three NBC night shows going for 23, 16, and 15. One interesting thing is that the opening ceremony did a 10.7/27 on NBCSN \u2014 nearly a third of the live-plus-7 viewership. With the Olympics, the bulk of the action is on Sunday with the opening and closing ceremonies, and then a number of medal-race swims during the Wednesday night coverage. The figure below illustrates the mix (all of the Olympic coverage, except for Olympic highlights, plus NBCSN\u2019s primetime specials since they\u2019re part of live programming).\n\nRatings for NBC (live-plus-7) Day of Games coverage and primetime specials for Thursday to Sunday, NBC, 2012 Olympics\n\nSource: ShowBuzzDaily 6:04 PM: We\u2019ve learned a bit more about the viewership for the NBC Universal-owned company\u2019s Sochi Olympics opening ceremonies (July 9), which had a whopping 15.5 million viewers. That\u2019s a solid number for any Olympics opening ceremony on network TV \u2014 which puts them in the top 15 since the 1996 Summer Games, according to Sports Business Daily.\n\nThe ceremonies, which took place at the Fisht Stadium in the Black Sea, were hosted by Bob Costas, and included skaters performing, gymnasts, a parade, figure skater Katarina Witt (whose husband is a Russian figure skating Olympian) and an Olympic flame on the ice, among a few others.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank each and every one of you who came out tonight in our opening ceremony on NBC and on NBCSN,\u201d Costas, 56, says in a video greeting. \u201cThis is the world\u2019s biggest audience for a TV broadcast.\u201d Costas later joked, \u201cI really love that we are an international broadcast. I like the foreign language and the languages we don\u2019t speak that much.\u201d\n\nSome of Sochi\u2019s big ticket advertisers have already signed on: Hyundai, MasterCard, Visa have deals in place with NBC, and McDonald\u2019s has a national advertiser buy on the opening ceremony through its Dollar Menu in TV, radio, and outdoor.

{"text": "The other major method of producing O 2 gas involves the use of a thermal decomposition of the halogen molecule(s) in a carrier gas. This method can be carried out at relatively higher pressures (1- 10 atm) and is suitable for producing pure O 2 from the halogen dioxide sources. This method, when carried out at lower temperatures, gives rise to the formation of other product species. The reaction of the halogen with the carrier gas has been used to advantage in the purification of gases (PCT Int. Appl. No. WO93/20694) and in various gas generation processes (Cf. U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,071).\n\nOne of the major difficulties encountered with thermal decomposition of halogen monoxide involves the formation of the thermal decomposition products which are mostly solid and thus form deposits on the surfaces of the reactor and the equipment which carries out the reaction, especially when an adiabatic reactor is used. Moreover, if reaction takes place above the melting point of the thermal decomposition products, the reactants also form a liquid phase which is difficult to separate from the solids. The solid phase of the products can clog the reaction zone of the reactor by interfering with the flow of gas. The gas phase of the reaction products is usually not useful.\nThe formation of solid products as a solid film on the walls of chemical reactors is a long standing problem for which many solution has been attempted without total success.\nThere is a general understanding in the art that the solid products can be prevented or substantially reduced from depositing by adding one or more inert solids or solids containing refractory oxides to the halogen monoxide stream. An improved method and apparatus to avoid or substantially reduce the formation of solid products in the reactor zone by minimizing the residence time of the feed gas in that zone is now being achieved because of the discovery of a novel solid product which is capable of preventing the undesirable formation of solid products and reducing or eliminating the deposition or fouling of refractory oxide solid particles on the reaction chamber walls or equipment. This invention therefore provides a new and novel method for preventing the formation of solid products in a system for the production of oxygen, fluorine and/or chlorine by gas phase pyrolysis of halogen monoxide gas feed.\nIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide a solid product generated by gas phase thermal decomposition of halogen monoxide that can effectively reduce foulant deposition and fouling of the surface of a reactor, for example, a continuous stirred tank reactor.\nIt is another object of this invention to provide a new and improved apparatus utilizing the disclosed solid product by generating a layer of the solid product on a portion of the reaction chamber of a chemical reactor and then introducing an inert gas stream to continuously flow through the solid layer so as to maintain the reaction and deposit of solids within a predetermined zone of the reactor.\nIt has been found that the solid product of this invention can be produced by contacting the halogen monoxide with a suitable solid material which preferably has a porosity ranging between about 20% and about 80% by weight and which preferably serves to absorb or hold on to the thermal decomposition products formed during thermal decomposition of the halogen monoxide. Generally, the amount of halogen monoxide in contact with the solid will be in the range of from about 5% to about 90% by weight based on the combined weight of the solid and the monoxide. Moreover, the reaction product in contact with the solid preferably should be in a fluid form or flow. It is preferred to produce the solid product in an aqueous, aqueous slurry or in the form of a slurry of the product in water or a carrier liquid. The slurry preferably contains less than about 5% by weight of an impurity which is a liquid (vapour or liquid) under the prevailing conditions of reaction.\nThe solid materials used in the methods of this invention to produce the solid product need to be capable of holding the solid generated during the thermal decomposition of the halogen monoxide, but preferably should not participate directly in the chemical reactions involved, thus reducing or avoiding any possibility of fouling or coking of the reactor or the reaction chamber walls. In the case of the use of sodium chloride and calcium chloride, the halogen monoxide will decompose into chloride gaseous species which are carried away by the inert gas stream flow. This results in the generation of the chloride solid product without any undesirable coke formation on the reactor walls. The solid product is preferably generated from solid material particles of a substantially similar size with a size from about 1 micron to about 100 microns or greater. The size is preferably less than about 5,000 microns because of the ease of fluidizing the solid material in a gas stream.\nThis invention therefore provides a new and novel method of preventing the formation of fouling deposits and undesirable deposits of solid products in", "label": 1, "id": 100533}

She had a friend who lived along the same line, she also told a policeman who was going to avenge the first killed that same night he came looking for Ivan Farras, who he believed killed her husband. That night he broke into the house and killed two more people. The last he saw, Ivan was sitting by a gas stove and he heard a woman scream and fall. His last words to his friend were \"the baby's ok, the police weren't here.\"\n\nIvan Farras' wife - A woman who has no clue about his life outside the house, she only knew that he liked the movies, and has his favorite music on and they would sing and dance together. She is described as being beautiful and calm, the only reason she could escape from the house was because Ivan's son was born. A real life story? No.\n\nShe was an actress, she had worked on the film before Ivan got in (at least that's the excuse this guy gave to a woman's magazine of why she could escape)\n\n\"You mean I escaped because the baby was born? Are you kidding me? I got locked up so I could be a mother! He said no one was allowed to leave the house because he needed to feed the baby!\"\"\n\nShe is portrayed as a character who was in love with Ivan Farras, as they had a \"love match\" type relationship. She is supposed to be a victim, so that when the film starts, she is still in love with him. She is described as being calm. She is calm because she thought she was going to die, as she told the police she heard a scream. How much was this woman calm when she heard her husband trying to strangle her friend to death, and she even saw him kill 2 more before she could yell at him?\n\n\"She said a police man came, so it sounded like he knew who killed her husband, but I never took seriously that policeman. You know why? I think he was hiding behind a tree because I think he was looking out the window. I was never afraid of the police because it was stupid to be afraid. I was scared, that's all. I told him that the baby was crying, and we were in danger. He said he would be on the way.\"\n\nAnother lie; the policeman never even mentioned that the man who was killed was her husband (who was also killed)\n\n\"But I told him and I was sure he knew who killed us. I wanted to stay and see what he wanted to do, and maybe my baby would be ok. I was worried that they would think my husband killed it. But I told him that it was my baby who was crying. We didn't have enough money to take anyone to the hospital, and I thought maybe the baby only got a cold there was no one there.\"\n\nWhat if Ivan Farras, was never actually looking for a wife? What if he was just looking for someone who would let him hide in their home. He would have a wife who would love him, would be perfect as his \"wife,\" he wouldn't had to have a love match like her, he wouldn't had to spend so much money to take her to the hospital, and he wouldn't had the problem of not being able to kill her husband.\n\nThe man who broke into the house; He also escapes, he kills 2 more people and is caught. He kills by shooting his victims from over the front porch, he wouldn't have a problem doing something like this, what if he really was one of these \"serial killers\"\n\n\"I think he was a serial killer because he kept shooting from the roof, and I think he wanted to do the same thing to me. Sometimes you can tell who is a weirdo because if you want to rob someone, and if you shoot the first person you see, you won't have problems.\"\n\n", "label": 1, "id": 100535}

{"text": "This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. And it was very very slow. If you think about it this is the first movie that made me feel this way. Yes it was the first time i ever felt that the movies i was watching were very slow. And that was the case with this movie as well. Maybe it had something to do with it. I felt a bit irritated. I felt that we were just sitting and talking about nothing. The movie was all about this, this, and this. I mean what was the point of the movie? How was that supposed to end? I don't know, but i felt like we were just talking and watching. I knew it was about pirates, and about treasure searching. Well, no it was about pirates searching for treasure. I'm sorry, but i don't know what else you could say. It wasn't about anything. If there was a plot maybe I wouldn't have understood it, but I'm sure that if I had it wouldn't be a very good movie if there was a plot. I'm not making fun of the movie, I'm just trying to make sense of something.\n\nThere were two parts of the movie. These two parts are called: pirates, and, pirates. The movie was in a sense divided in two groups: The pirates, and, the pirates.\n\nBut, I still didn't like the pirates,\n\nI only liked the pirates in the first group, the one with the gold.\n\nThere were 2 or 3 ships to begin with. It was a crew of one captain, and 1 or 2 other people. But, there weren't too many ships.\n\nThen, there was the captain of the gold. He is the only one that doesn't have names.\n\nThen, there was the captain of the silver, then there was the captain of the bronze and finally, there was the captain of the iron.\n\nI liked the captain of the gold when he met the captain of the silver. Even though that meeting happened at the island, i like it when they met by mistake when they went to the island. We didn't like the sea at all.\n\nWhy was the movie all about pirates? No. It wasn't so much about pirates, since, the pirates, when we got to know them in the third part, in the end of the movies, they were just plain crazy. The movie was about a ship, and there was a treasure on it. I believe that maybe, i'm not sure, that there were more than one pirate. But, i think that the reason that the movie took so long was because they searched for the treasure. But, they couldn't find it. Maybe there wasn't enough men to do their work.\n\nThe movie also took a lot of time because they were talking about things that would make people happy. The pirates were talking to the people and they talked about the sea and the island and also a few things that made me happy. For instance, the man who was watching the water and the beach, the beach people. I liked them because they were nice and they had a nice life. I felt like they were enjoying life. Their life was very nice.\n\nThe movie could have been way better, if there was a plot.\n\nThere was a plot, but it was a lie. If there was a plot, it was the lie of this movie.\n\nMaybe it is the best pirate movie in the world. But, it isn't. It is definitely the worst movie i've ever seen. It is, and, i hate the pirates of this movie. I hate the pirates of this movie very much. And, if I had to come up with a reason of why I hated the pirates of the movie, it would be 'cause there wasn't a plot.\"\n\nThe movie was horrible. The whole thing took place on the island. They searched and searched and searched. Then they finally found the pirate gold. And, they were finally happy. No, it wasn't happy. It wasn't anything that could make you feel like, you were happy. It was very depressing. I just think that the movie was so bad because it wasn't good. Well, not good, it wasn't really a movie at all. It was a joke.\n\nI didn't get why they were chasing the pirate gold,\n\nThey were chasing the pirate one.\n\nIt wasn't a story that was good and believable. It was a story, that was a lie. I hated everything about the movie. First of all, the part that was filmed on the island. I hated the parts, that were filmed on the beach, the beach was so bad to look at, I felt that it was really bad. Everything that they filmed wasn't good. Like, there weren't any people on the streets. They weren't walking. It was all fake. I'm sure this movie", "label": 1, "id": 100539}
{"text": "One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent years comes out this week from indie producer/director Alexandre Aja that shows, for at least 90 minutes, why he\u2019s a future Oscar contender, as well as a horror film legend.\n\nDirected by Laurent Cantet, the film opens with a gruesome video clip that plays into how the filmmakers have decided to open their story, depicting the violent murder of a man and his girlfriend. Cantet then cuts away to a voiceover from some doctor who\u2019s explaining why that kind of gruesome image would be perfectly rational to someone suffering from a mental illness that can lead them to consider torturing people. As long as someone doesn\u2019t blame the patient, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s just about finding a way to justify what we did.\u201d\n\nNext up is a character who\u2019s not entirely sane himself, played by Edgar Ramirez, a former dancer who\u2019s become convinced he\u2019s on some kind of mission to protect his child from a violent future where everyone will be killed by a series of black monoliths. \u201cMy only purpose is to make sure my daughter will grow up in a society that is not one you and I had chosen here in the States,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the color of your skin, or your social status. The only difference is the deathrate. I choose to prevent as many people from dying as I can, by offering them the cure.\u201d And that leads him straight to an asylum where he will be killed \u2014 but not before he has a conversation with a psychiatrist (Sarah Polley) and a young boy suffering from similar fears regarding violence.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by a lot of very, very good filmmaking. While I\u2019m familiar with the director, Cantet, from a past project that dealt with cannibalism in a similarly dark and realistic way, and have reviewed the first trailer for this film, I felt the full length preview left me with a lot of questions that probably need to be answered in the film (I\u2019ll get there, just a little later in the review). So I went to the theater last night to see it on the first night, and can report it was everything a horror fan could hope it\u2019d be.\n\nAja has a great eye for framing and composition. He cuts between the different locations at a quick pace, building a narrative of intense unease as a sequence of events unfolds, never really letting you have a break for breathing. There\u2019s one scene where Cantet shows an elderly woman having dinner with her sister (Maria Bonita) and is shown with an extremely strong zoom. By that point in the film, it\u2019s been well established that both her sister and her husband have been murdered by a killer obsessed with black monoliths, with Bonita in the role of the young girl who saw them being killed and now is too scared to tell anyone what she sees. Later on, we\u2019re shown in a flashback that the murders were recorded on video (using a telephoto lens to zoom in on the victim and its body) by a woman named Alice (Sarah Polley) \u2014 again, the same woman we\u2019ve seen since she first arrived at the asylum. She later turns out to be a member of a secret group that\u2019s trying to find a way to stop the monoliths. So why does a very powerful woman become obsessed with the murders and join what she hopes is a group that will ultimately help her find an answer to them?\n\nYou get the feeling that it\u2019s going to be pretty dark material, and Cantet and company have delivered with some of the most disturbing imagery ever seen in any film. Most of the film\u2019s violence comes from Ramirez\u2019s character, and we also get a brief but brutal sequence involving a young boy named Theo. The boy, whose home life has been somewhat fractured from his parents\u2019 divorce, has a fear of violence \u2014 he even carries a gun. At the beginning of the film, Cantet shows him looking into a mirror where he sees what looks like a black monolith behind him, and he starts to break down in sobs.\n\nTheo\u2019s father (Antonio Banderas) arrives and looks through the boy\u2019s closet, sees the gun and then gives his son an injection of tranquilizers \u2014 and in the process, an image is projected on the wall behind them. It\u2019s a portrait of Alice and the man she\u2019s dating \u2014 Theo\u2019s father. At that point, the boy is fully sedated and the scene changes from the two of them to Alice looking through the boy\u2019s closet, which is loaded with black monoliths, to the father entering the room and shooting himself.\n\nAnd that\u2019s as", "label": 1, "id": 100540}

{"text": "efficient phase cycling schemes remain a challenge for nmr techniques. The methodologies to perform multiple independent scans at different echo time delays have been developed only for the case of the standard one (^1^H) channel. A direct consequence of this is that the complete data set for a spin-3/2 nucleus can only be obtained at a unique echo time. The approach we have developed to overcome this issue is the use of multiple-channel nmr.^[@ref38]^ The sample was transferred to the NMR spectrometer and the channel was tuned and matched by means of manual, manual-selective power cycling for each channel prior to acquisition of the data.^[@ref38]^ In [Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, some examples of the experiments performed on selected spin-3/2 nuclei demonstrate how the proposed method works.

Some examples on multiple-channel nmr experiments to investigate the chemical shift and scalar coupling are reported at the beginning of this paper. (ii) The number of channels should be chosen to get the complete data set for the desired number of echoes. (iii) In some cases, in order to complete the set of multi-echo experiments for a given spin-3/2 nucleus, one has to use a long recycle delay *T*~*r*~ to obtain all the echoes from low-to-high-field recoupling, as indicated in [Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C.

{"text": "objectivethe assessment of potentially confounding factors affecting colon microbiota composition and function \\[[@B6]\\].\n\nA major goal of this study was to assess the utility of 16S rRNA gene-based analyses (i.e., pyrosequencing of V3-V4 region) for monitoring human gut microbiomes in response to dietary intervention. The ability of the 16S rRNA gene-based analysis technique to capture changes in colonic microbiomes following dietary intervention has been suggested repeatedly. Such changes include a change in total number of bacteria (i.e., decreased colonic load), and changes in the relative quantities of bacteria within a single species. However, data obtained from studies focusing on dietary intervention are equivocal since the observed changes were inconsistent. For example, studies assessing dietary intervention on *Bifidobacterium*-dominated microbiomes showed that *Bifidobacterium* load is significantly higher following dietary intervention, but this increase was not accompanied by a decrease in overall load \\[[@B33]--[@B5]\\]. In addition, an increase in*Enterobacteriaceae* was observed following dietary intervention and was associated with a decrease in *Bifidobacterium* \\[[@B12], [@B33]\\].\n\nThe results of this pilot study provide the first observation of an increase in *Akkermansia* after intake of a gluten containing diet ([Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Although, the relative abundance of *Akkermansia* is not reported, high abundance of *Akkermansia muciniphila* has been shown to correlate with a significant reduction of *Bacteroides* load following dietary intervention \\[[@B32], [@B34], [@B15]\\].\n\n4.1. Changes in Human Colon Microbiome {#sec4.1}\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn an attempt to explain variations in findings obtained from 16S rRNA gene-based analysis of changes in human colon microbiota, two hypotheses are tested: (1) changes in the total number of cells (i.e., increased colonic load) following introduction of gluten-containing food leads to an increase in *Akkermansia* abundance, and (2) high variation in the methodologies used as well as the criteria for defining significant changes in human colon microbiota. It should also be kept in mind that in view of low relative abundance of *Akkermansia muciniphila* in the control group of this study, a large number of replicates was used and only five subjects were included in this pilot study to ensure sufficient statistical power. Thus, while the increase in *Akkermansia* in this study is not statistically significant, it does provide an important first step toward a more complete understanding of changes in human colon microbiota during nutrition intervention.\n\nThe findings of a significant increase in *Akkermansia* abundance observed in this study are not surprising, since an increased abundance of *Akkermansia* has been previously reported following dietary intervention in a study by Zhang et al. \\[[@B31]\\]. In addition, a recent report suggested a correlation between fecal concentrations of *Saccharomyces* and dietary fiber intake \\[[@B14]\\]. Since dietary fiber intake was controlled during this study, an increase in *Akkermansia* abundance following dietary intervention is consistent with an increase in dietary fiber intake \\[[@B14]\\]. Thus, it is plausible that increased fecal concentrations of *Saccharomyces sensu stricto* after introduction of gluten-containing products were in general association with an increase in dietary fiber intake, which in turn was associated with an increase in abundance of *Akkermansia*. In future studies, it will be important to evaluate total dietary fiber intake and dietary component intake, such as wheat fiber in the form of arabinoxylans and other indigestible dietary fiber.\n\nAn increase in *Akkermansia* was observed only following the intervention by a food which contained high amount of fiber and low glycemic index. Previous studies have suggested that *Akkermansia* increases following the introduction of diets rich in dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble \\[[@B9], [@B29], [@B7]\\]. Interestingly, the only study that failed to find increases in *Akkermansia* following dietary intervention utilized a diet low in dietary fiber and high in glycemic index (35% of total calories in the form of starch, 50% of total calories in the form of sucrose and 15% of total calories in the form of refined table sugar) \\[[@B14]\\].\n\nChanges in the human colon microbiota following introduction of low-fiber diets have been linked to enrichment in potentially harmful bacterial strains in the colon with a corresponding increase in the number of *Enterobacteriaceae* \\", "label": 1, "id": 100546}
{"text": "THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world's history. What started out as a modest affair in the Italian piazza of Bergamo on New Year's Eve 1887 reached Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre six months later with the addition of an extravagant chorus line. As the new century approached, the Carusos continued to tour the United States and Europe, where they were received by royalty and their audiences were transfixed at their show's high drama and exotic appeal. The press, however, never warmed to Maria. \"I hate to say it, but it seems to me,\" remarked the New York Sun, \"that it is the most immoral show on earth.\"\n\nDespite such criticism the Carusos' show became an enormous phenomenon. For decades their names were synonymous with music hall. When the war finally ended, the Caruso Company returned to Italy and in 1925 the opera composer Ruggerio Leoncavallo composed a libretto, written by his wife Domenica Gilardoni, and premiered it in New York with Maria in the title role. Then, in 1927, at the urging of the US-based Caruso Society the New York Herald Tribune published a book, La Bella Figura (The Beautiful Figure), based on his correspondence with the tenor. After this, the Caruso Company returned to America, where they could again command the kind of money which had been made possible on Broadway by the Great War\u2014which is more than anyone else made in the first half of the last century.\n\nOver the next few years the Carusos toured the United States, making numerous personal appearances, and gave many radio broadcasts, earning as much as a million dollars per year. In 1928 they moved to a New York apartment on the fashionable Madison Avenue at Eighty-fifth Street where they lived a life of comfortable opulence, entertaining guests and occasionally receiving foreign dignitaries at the apartment.\n\nThe Carusos were both famous and infamous. They were not simply opera superstars, they were also the subject of two best-selling biographies, The Caruso Story by Domenico Caruso and La Bella Figura: The Story of Arturo Caruso by Robert R. MacAdams. They both wrote for newspapers and published biographical sketches for magazines (including those for The Literary Digest and Vanity Fair), which contributed to the general image of the tenor as brash, vain, arrogant, egocentric, and vain. But the Carusos were complex, sensitive, and charismatic people, and on his rare occasions of public expression the tenor was anything but narcissistic. \"On stage and off,\" he told The Literary Digest in 1929, \"I am modest, kindly, and considerate. I speak the truth.\"\n\nA decade after he was known all over the world as the greatest singer of his time, the tenor was in great demand for personal appearances. He toured the United States constantly, singing, lecturing and signing copies of Autobiography of an Opera Singer. He was the toast of society. He entertained Princess Ileana of Romania who wrote in her diary, \"The Caruso home in New York is an artistic salon.\" His apartment in New York was the scene at two-a-day lunch parties. There he would sit at the far end of the table on a tall, straight chair and would listen intently to everyone else's words, then wait until everyone was quiet and say: \"No, you haven't heard my side of it yet. Now I want you to hear mine.\" In his book the famous American actress Katherine Lorring recalled:\n\nHe would be very much in humor, telling anecdotes about people, but he would keep the whole world's secrets, too.... He could be extremely charming. But you had to watch him because he would turn the charm on very quickly. You could see it go, and then you had a moment before... the other side would come out. And there was no getting out of it; it was something about you personally that he felt you had given too much.\n\nThe Carusos were also known as the Great Carusos. No-one was so modest as to mention the second Caruso. It seemed impossible that one individual could dominate the world with his voice and have not already appropriated the world for himself. His singing career was a phenomenon. And it came at a time when many singers in opera were beginning to fail. Enrico Caruso (no relation) would go on to create the standard for tenor singing as it had been known for at least 100 years before the twentieth century.\n\nThe voice of the Carusos\u2014so powerful, so beautiful and so unique\u2014resonated all over the world during their career as one of the great events of the age.

{"text": "Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to recognize foreign molecules, usually pathogens, for immunity or defense. The most common types are transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, which are typically composed of an N-terminal, variable light chain variable domain (VL\u2212VD), a short hydrophobic stretch, a hydrophobic or charged membrane-spanning domain, followed by a constant light chain variable domain (CL\u2212VD) and a C-terminal, cytoplasmic tail domain ([@bib18]). The V domain of these receptors has three variable regions termed D, J, and C and a hypervariable region between and around VD and VJ (known as framework 2 (FR2) or complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)). Several groups of organisms have evolved receptors with the same overall topology but different lengths and/or number of V domains ([@bib31]).\n\nThere are many types of PRRs with the same overall topology. They recognize microorganisms, parasites or injured tissue, and activate an immune response. This diverse set of receptors also recognizes molecules in the intracellular environment or in the extracellular matrix, including nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, single-stranded RNAs and modified RNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs/glycoproteins), glycoproteins, nucleoproteins, lipoproteins, and peptides.\n\nThe largest group of PRRs consists of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize extracellular microbial motifs such as nucleic acids and peptides and signal to the immune system. For example, TLR1/2 recognizes triacylated lipoprotein and lipomycine, while TLR5 recognizes flagellin, and TLR3 recognizes double-stranded (ds) RNAs and certain synthetic dsRNAs ([@bib28]). Other PRRs involve pathogen recognition domains in larger, structurally distinct proteins with a role in pathogen identification or in signaling of the immune response. PRR domains include the following: (1) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, such as those of the Ig-superfamily, which are often called \"sushi\" domains; (2) Bacterial-S-layers (Bsl)-associated domains; (3) Bacterial-DNA-binding (BdB)-like domains, (4) RNA-binding (RNP)-like domains, (5) Fibronecrosis (Fn)-associated domains (fibronectin-type III and -type V domains), (6) galactosyl- and lipo-oligosaccharide (GAL/LPS)-binding domains (which recognize carbohydrates); (7) P-proteins, also named LRR-Proteins (LRR-PR1) or LRR-R-proteins; and (8) the recently identified pentraxins ([@bib3]; [@bib21]). These latter are structurally distinctive receptors of the complement system with a characteristic pentaxin fold, which include the pentraxins C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid P (SAP), and short pentraxin 3 (SAT3), as well as various novel pentaxin-like molecules identified by genomic approaches (Rey et al. 2005).\n\nMany mammalian TLRs share the same three-domain structure, but with variation in the CDRs of the V domain ([@bib25]); as an example, TLR1 has one VD, while TLR3 has three. The number of V domains varies from 12 in human *TLR2* ([@bib15]; [@bib12]) to seven in *TLR1* ([@bib13]) and nine in *TLR2* ([@bib24]).\n\nIn this study, we have screened nonredundant human cDNA libraries and identified a novel pattern matching receptor with 7 different V domains in two genes called *TLR7* (OMIM [600838](600838)) and *TLR9* (OMIM [600817](600817)).\n\nOne of the genes of this receptor, *TLR7*, has been isolated and sequenced as a part of two different studies, and an earlier analysis of its transcript suggested that it may be involved in the sensing of single-stranded (ss) and ds nucleic acids ([@bib12]; [@bib17]).\n\nThe TLR7 protein includes a VL-VD with 12 V domains of Ig superfamily, an unstructured insertion domain, and a VD of Ig superfamily.

Oxygen-rich combustion environments are commonly encountered in combustion chambers, such as the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine or combustion region of a rocket engine, and at combustion plumes resulting from the destruction of a military or commercial structure by fire. A runaway reaction within an oxygen-rich environment leads to an increase in the oxygen level to an extent which can cause the combustion environment to be explosive, leading to a catastrophic over-expansion or detonation of the structure and possible rupture of nearby structures, e.g., due to thermal loading.\nThe magnitude of oxygen enhancement due to a flame has been modeled by many researchers as being proportional to:\n                    ln        \u2062                  \u2003                \u2062                              (                                          P                \u2062                                  \u2003                                \u2062                                  O                  2                                            -                              m                \u2062                                  \u2003                                \u2062                P                \u2062                                  \u2003                                \u2062                C                                              )                2              \u2062                              (                                  k                  \u2061                                      (                                          x                      2                      ", "label": 1, "id": 100550}

Despite its failure at the box office, \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d turned a huge number of people onto Verhoeven and his distinct brand of visual style, before going on to become a worldwide bestseller, receiving a well-deserved round of Oscar nominations as well as winning two BAFTAs and a Golden Globe.\n\nFollowing that win, of course, the franchise got its own sequel \u2013 but that did not go to plan, as the \u201cBasic Instinct 2\u201d screenplay, written by David E. Kelley (\u201cChicago Hope\u201d, \u201cDesigning Women\u201d), was shelved, and no script was ever produced.\n\n\u201cI think the idea of a sequel is interesting,\u201d Verhoeven told me as we sat down to watch the film last month. \u201cI don\u2019t regret not making this film because the original idea was good. So why don\u2019t I make it on my own?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could do what I want to do, I wouldn\u2019t have any fears now,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe idea was very original, the original concept \u2013 and the story is a nice story. It was very suspenseful. You didn\u2019t see what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Verhoeven\u2019s original idea was a lot more provocative than what Kelley was writing. \u201cIf this idea is gonna happen, they have to get rid of the whole courtroom and make the whole trial out of a disco,\u201d Verhoeven explains. \u201cThey have to have some crazy disco. You would know immediately this story\u2019s going to be an erotic thriller. You can\u2019t be in a modern courtroom and have sex in here. That would be silly!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody had asked me a long time ago, who do you think could write a screenplay like the original \u2018Basic Instinct'? That\u2019s really a difficult question, I\u2019d say you can only come from an area that you like a lot. Because it\u2019s just so imaginative\u2026 You gotta be imaginative. So if I didn\u2019t come from a similar kind of style and world, I\u2019d not really come up with a story so unique.\u201d\n\nBut was it that style that held him back? \u201cOne day I might have a story that would be in my way of making a new movie, and then I would really not know what to do. I would just give up. And then one day I said, you know, if I ever want to make movies again, I have to start something really simple, like a small, short film.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you feel satisfied you can make a movie\u2026and that is a way to get over that fear!\u201d He laughed. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the kind of director who really needs to be sure. But it\u2019s really a good way to test yourself, also you can do it on a very low budget, and I think you can find one on YouTube. It\u2019s not very long. You can make it yourself.\u201d\n\nSo how is the movie?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good movie!\u201d Verhoeven says. \u201cGood looking movie, even though it\u2019s very dark.\u201d He\u2019s clearly no fan the film, as the opening is a reworking of the original film, with Al Pacino as an FBI profiler looking into a series of murders that take place around America.\n\nWhile \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d sees the \u201cpersona\u201d of the character that Sharon Stone\u2019s detective KITT becomes, \u201cDressed to Kill\u201d, though, focuses on the real Sharon Stone, as another cop, played by David Keith, a friend of her character\u2019s in \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d, finds himself in the same predicament.\n\n\u201cTo me, \u2018Dressed to Kill\u2019 is one of the best sequel movies.

To this day it is one of my all time favorite shows. The script and the direction is all over the place, but we are having a lot of fun.\n\nWe have a \"Bachelor Party\" going on in our house right now....so we are up at 8:00 am and have to make breakfast and get ready for work. Then we come home; relax and have a long lunch; go to work; and have dinner. The day is done by 5:00 pm where we are playing Monopoly with a girlfriend. Then, bedtime. And the next day we do it all over again. It's very hard on the poor children when all of a sudden mom and dad are back from work and we have to move furniture around and make a new life. This morning, we got ready for work and have been shooting all day. It's a new day. Another day of doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nThis is not a story about a house or a new life. It's about a group of women trying to make a new life and get out of their old life. I am a person who wants to try new things and I have never been one to go over the top on anything. But I have had enough of the same old same old way of doing things. We all have to look forward to making new things, getting out of old ways, and creating a better life.\n\nI am not complaining or anything but the kids have not had any sleep. They've had nothing until 5:00am and they've been up since 5:00 am. It's not complaining. It's reality. We're tired because the reality is that we have to make lunch; go to work; come home and make dinner, take shower, go to bed, then do it all over again. It gets very tiring. When something change we cannot be unhappy.\n\nWe are planning something for the kids and something for us. We're working so we can make the most of this beautiful day. I'm so happy it's a beautiful day. I may not like everything that comes back but I will work hard at it. We have to work hard or we will not do anything at all. We have to keep going and moving and growing. All the time. We're making this change. A new thing, a new way of being. We cannot go back and be the old us no more. We cannot revert back to the old way of doing things.\n\nYes, life has been very tiring and we need to rest. The day has been very full. The kids have been doing more than their share of working. They've had no rest. I really wanted to spend some time with them. I thought I would get something done around the house but my house looks worse than a junkyard.\n\nWe do need to slow down on our living standards just for one day. It is not realistic for us to expect to be living in five star hotel, with four maids, and with the best, most beautiful foods.\n\nThis is my dream and we're going to take all of the time we have and be thankful for it. At the same time we're trying to grow and make something new. Our living situation. Everything we do to make a better life for our kids.\n\nLife is not fair. We can't have a day off. Or a week off. We have to work very hard to get to this place. We have to work very hard to make this happen.\n\nWe have plans and goals for ourselves. We are going to set up what our goals are for that day.\n\nWe are going to take a day off. At this point in time, a day off is a luxury and we can say we are going to take a day off.\n\nIt's all too confusing. We have a lot of people trying to get there for many reasons but it's all over the place. We have people who want to do it with us, people who think that they are doing it for us, and those who just want to be there. What's this about a party anyway? I wish that it was a way for one of us to call it quits or to say, okay people, this isn't working. We can do something else.\n\nI understand everyone wanting to get away. To do what you want do.\n\nSome people can't afford to do it. You know, they have to pay the rent and they have to pay their car payment. They just have to figure out how to make their cars run so they can keep their jobs and do what they need to do.\n\nHow can I complain about that?\n\nIt's not easy. It may", "label": 1, "id": 100555}

PMID:18643055\n\nFull Text Available Microarray based classification methods are among the most commonly used machine learning techniques for the diagnosis of cancer and classification of disease states. Typically, the microarrays used in these studies are designed and fabricated specifically for the given disease of interest. However, this approach is costly and time consuming. In our study, we have used a technique called unsupervised learning to identify genes that are differentially expressed in various cancer types. These genes could be used for cancer classification and they can contribute in the classification of various disease states apart from cancer. This approach would be useful in cases where information for specific disease types is limited and microarrays or proteomics data are not available.\n\nThe present study has been planned in order to develop in-silico microarray (iMS) based methods for prediction and in-situ (iMS) evaluation using the GeneChip oligonucleotide array representing microarrays to obtain the expression profiling data obtained from human and canine prostate and testicular tissues from the perspective of genetic research. For the purpose of these studies, we have screened out genes with differentially expressed level in prostate and testicular tissues in human and canine using the iMS-based approach and validated this in-silico data via immunohistochemical evaluation of the expression status of the selected genes. We screened out the gene set with the expression level significantly different in the cell nuclei than in the cytoplasm in the canine tissue. All selected genes were overexpressed in prostate and testicular tissues in humans and dogs. However, seven of these genes were undetectable or hardly detectable in the testicular tissues of humans, whereas in-silico evaluation in this study has shown the downregulation of these genes in testicular tissues in comparison with prostate tissues. We could see a similarity in the microarray patterns with the immunohistochemical data except for the downregulation of PDE7A and ARL6IP1 genes in the nuclei of canine testicular tissues. The downregulated expression of these genes could suggest the negative influence on spermatogenesis in this species.\n\nThe present study has been planned in order to develop in-silico microarray (iMS) based methods for prediction and in-situ (iMS) evaluation using the GeneChip oligonucleotide array representing microarray to obtain the expression profiling data obtained from human and canine prostate and testicular tissues from the perspective of genetic research.

{"text": "The film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of the entire series.\n\nFirst released during a time of rampant film inflation, it has a lot of the signature elements of the genre - the opening action scenes, the heroine's relationship with the villain, the exotic locale, even the soundtrack, courtesy of Maurice Jarre's classic scores, seems as authentic as you can reasonably hope to get. The result is a film with a lot of style, but also of a certain charm.\n\nI will probably never get a chance to see it on the big screen, but if you had told me this was John Gielgud's final film, I think I would have done just as well as one of his previous four starring roles in The Tenth Man, The Ladykillers and Anastasia are just fantastic.\n\nThe two are often seen together in the same frame.\n\nAs for the book, that is where the real fascination for me lies. In the prologue, written by the author, there are some revealing insights into the making of the film:\n\n\"It was not only my good fortune to have the great actor Sir John Gielgud, who starred in the film, as my mentor in the theatre. For a second time I had the privilege of directing him. I can well remember the day it happened. We were on the stage of the London Palladium and I had asked him a direct question about the choice of an actress to play opposite him in his new film called \"The Love Song.\" His answer could have been written and spoken by the finest, most refined of actors, but Sir John and even then the man was only a working actress. \"What's all this about,\" - he asked. \"Why are you making such a fuss?\" \"No fuss, no fuss,\" I said, \"I am not making a fuss, but -\" he put his glass of milk down, leant forward and with those blue eyes of his looked straight into my eyes \"I ask you - what is an actress?\" I looked at his face without any change. He was smiling, looking straight into my eyes. \"An actress is a woman whose talent and personality are not fully disclosed - who must pretend and conceal. She is a person whose personality must never be fully revealed. \"To get such an actress is not quite as easy as picking up a flower. It is rather like having the sun in a greenhouse.\" \"An actress!\" he laughed, \"And do you know why I became an actor?\" - and then he told me the simple story of his life - how he had been a young English soldier in France, had been terribly wounded and in a fever dream, saw his own father - Sir Wilfred Kendal - who died when he was three, standing in a far-off country, laughing and crying at the same time. And then he had looked up and there was the sun, still shining brightly and was filled with that desire to be a son again and his father's laughter filled his heart and he became an actor. \"And that is what I want,\" I said. He answered after a moment's silence and a little look of regret. \"I should like to go with you,\" he said. But it was impossible. In fact the last months of his life were his happiest and he had too strong a spirit of the theatre, which he had nurtured since a boy, to ever leave any profession, even a good profession like his. That is why he asked me and I can say without any offence - if he asked me the question again now, I would probably reply no differently. \"So you see,\" he said simply, \"I would never have had to answer.\" \"But you are the greatest,\" I shouted at him, \"the most famous actor of all time and more important - this man, Sir Basil Zaharoff, your producer, says you'll play this man.\" \"Yes,\" he said simply, taking a piece of cake, \"I think perhaps he will.\"\n\nAnd I have to admit that he is a far better story-teller than his character in the film, a man with a dry sense of humour on his face, but a heart that must have broken a thousand times. The film does not make that clear at all. All we know is that the film is the story of Zaharoff being pursued by the German Secret Police and of his last desperate attempt to sell the English weapon that he has been working on.\n\n\"Why do you want to do this, Zaharoff?\" The secret agent asks him. The answer is not very clear at first, \"because I am in debt beyond recovery,\" he says, but slowly reveals more and more as the film unfolds. We learn about the birth of his son, who was to become an engineer - about his family in Russia where he was educated. We learn about the death of his wife whom he has loved since childhood. But why Zaharoff has become a German patriot", "label": 1, "id": 100557}
{"text": "On Sunday, President Barack Obama traveled to Afghanistan to do what he's not always shown the courage to do during his presidency: address the nation of Americans and Americans abroad.\n\nSince he came to office in 2009, Obama has addressed a number of large audiences around the world about America and American values\u2014including a \"fireside chat\" before a joint session of Congress, and a speech to the United Nations.\n\nHis speech to the Afghan government Tuesday should have been big enough to match them. Yet while he was delivering it, more than 1,000 Americans were dead in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.\n\nAnd Obama got his opportunity. He talked\u2014or tried to talk, and failed.\n\nObama promised the U.S. and the rest of the world an end to the war (we had seen enough of the bloody results) and he gave some hints that he might be willing to leave a residual force behind in Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent new attacks.\n\nBut most of his speech was about the wars he inherited from President George W. Bush in Afghanistan and Iraq. He even noted that, having \"left behind\" a lot of American troops, the new strategy in Afghanistan\u2014that the U.S. would focus on Al Qaeda\u2014had turned out not to be enough.\n\nWe had to change, Obama said, going on to describe the end to the American military's \"temporary surge\" in Afghanistan and the beginning of a new strategy.\n\nThe Afghan government (with U.S. help), he explained, now controls 60 percent of the country. The international community and the U.S. are training and assisting the new police and the Afghan forces (all the people and resources the Afghan government asks for, including American personnel).\n\nWhat else?\n\n\"We also learned some hard lessons,\" Obama said. \"Most of all, we learned that the Taliban were never going to reconcile with the Afghan government, and that Al Qaeda would never give up its sanctuary in Pakistan.\"\n\nA \"dispute over the legal status of landmines\" kept the two countries from signing a long-term security agreement, Obama said. And there were problems with corruption and governance within the Afghan government.\n\nObama noted that the war has \"cost the lives of more than 2,300 American soldiers and hundreds of American contractors. We have spent $110 billion.\"\n\nAnd, he's willing to admit, a lot of it wasted.\n\nIf you were to ask who won the war, Obama would likely say it was the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\n\n\"I want to repeat again what we tried to prove in these last nine months,\" Obama said. \"The coalition that's fighting against Al Qaeda is succeeding. The Taliban are losing ground.\"\n\nAs for the future, Obama acknowledged that it would be a struggle.\n\nIn Afghanistan, he said, \"We can't just turn the clock back. But with NATO's assistance and partnership, Afghans can now take their own country back.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the Afghan constitution is now about to go into effect.\n\n\"They now will be able to form their own government,\" he said. \"And our partnership in Afghanistan will be based on a set of shared values, the deepest aspirations of the Afghan people\u2014and a strong, enduring partnership between our nations.\"\n\nHe said he'd never expected to be able to leave Afghanistan with \"hard-earned\" victory like this one, \"but it is an achievement worth celebrating.\"\n\nHe also talked about Iraq again.\n\nObama said he didn't rule out staying in Iraq past the end of this year\u2014if Iraqis can't make their own country work.\n\nBut he was willing to let Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki figure it out alone.\n\nAnd al-Maliki should know it: If he continues to try to oppress Sunnis, Obama said, there will be consequences. Obama promised that the U.S. would not \"leave Iraqis to repeat those mistakes.\"\n\nHe then took the opportunity\u2014and responsibility\u2014to say two more very big things:\n\n\"The people of Iraq have always been at their best when they have chosen their own destiny. And they will show the resolve at a later date to do what they believe is best for them. And they will make their voices heard.\" (Yes, Obama's doing that, too.)\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" Obama said. \"Our commitment to support a sovereign, democratic, and unified Iraq remains ironclad.\" (Good to see that one again.)\n\nObama ended his speech by saying: \"I'm also hopeful that the new security agreement that we have signed with the Afghans will make it much easier for us to leave a residual force in Afghanistan. So that we can go after Al Qaeda with far fewer American troops\u2014and leave a small, but robust, force behind to help them", "label": 1, "id": 100558}
{"text": "In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was the isolation of the first naturally-occurring opiate, morphine, in poppies by the English plant physiologist and surgeon, Sir Henry S. Dale, provided an opportunity for the synthesis of further synthetic opiates. Over the ensuing two decades, hundreds of opioids and closely-related synthetic compounds have been isolated, sequentially tested and synthesized, the active ingredients in many being selective and in others not selective for their particular opioid receptor subtype (Kohji M. et al. 1990. Neuropharm., 20, 157-62; for recent reviews, see Martin K. J. et al. Neurosci, 1995, 95, 1-30; Martin K. J. and Williams P. J. Drugs of the Future, 2000, 25, 717-720). While the use of some non-selective opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, has been valuable in medicine, the development of opioid receptor subtype-selective compounds, such as opioid analgesics, for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, has attracted great interest. In animal models, subtype-selective compounds have been shown to be more effective than non-selective opiates in relieving pain (Farr C. A. et al. 1994. Eur. J. Pharmacol., 261, 607-9; Shire M. J. et al. 1991, Br. J. Anaesth., 67, 10-8, and Farr C. A. et al. Drugs of the Future, 17, 1195-202).\nThree major classes of opioid receptor have been defined pharmacologically (Namen J. A. 1993. Pharmacol. Rev., 45, 3-24). The main division is between \u03bc-, \u03b4-, and \u03ba-type receptors, the opioids agonising each of these subpopulations differentially. There is some evidence to suggest that all three types belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors (GCPRs). In this classification of opioid receptor subtypes, a \u2018\u2212\u2019 sign denotes that the opioid has the highest affinity for that particular subtype, while a \u2018+\u2019 sign denotes that it has appreciable affinity for that subtype. It should thus be noted that a number of partial agonists are known that may bind either to one particular opioid receptor subtype, or to more than one.\n\u03bc Opioid receptor (MOR)\nMOR agonists have analgesic properties and, depending on the particular opioid used, have varying intrinsic activities. While all analgesic opioids are MOR antagonists (naloxone) they also show a characteristic dose-sparing opioid antagonist effect (MOU effect) (Ziviec S. et al. 1988, Pain, 32:265-81), which indicates that some agonists can reduce the analgesic dose of co-administered opioid agonists. This characteristic is thought to arise from their ability to compete with other agonists of the receptor for binding to the receptor, thus decreasing the proportion of opioid receptors occupied by endogenous or exogenous ligand (Ziviec, S. et al. 1988, supra). The \u2018MOU Effect\u2019 is thought to be caused by a receptor interaction with the endogenous opioid peptide, endomorphin as disclosed in Ziviec et al. Nature, 1990, 345:719-21. MOR agonists may also cause respiratory depression, which limits their clinical use, however, the risk of clinically relevant respiratory depression, is small with these compounds when given in a dose that selectively occupies MOR with little or no action at \u03ba opioid receptor (MOU/RESP), (Walsh, P. R. 1991, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 209, 283-7). MOR agonists also tend to have high affinity at \u03ba opioid receptors and, along with endogenous opioids, may interact at this site to modulate breathing and other functions.\n\u03b4 Opioid receptor (DOR)\nOpioid agonists that display selectivity for this subtype are both well known in the prior art. For example \u2018stag\u2019 or \u2018stigma\u2019 toxins, which were isolated from the venoms of the saw-scaled viper (Trimeresurus scutatus) and the aculeatus snakes (Acinantophorus spp.) (Bertrand, R. et al. 1978, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 89, 654-60) are selective DOR agonists, which have been considered as useful analgesic agents. \u03b4 opioid (DOR) agonists also have many activities. Although DOR agonists do not generally produce respiratory depression (MOU/RESP), as \u03bc receptor agonists do (Ziviec, S. et al., supra), they can cause emesis (DOR/EMET", "label": 1, "id": 100559}

{"text": "over the course of its motion through the galaxy, and it loses orbital energy as it\ndrags along the magnetic field lines in a process called \u201cgyrating.\u201d The\ngyration is a way that matter can lose energy, and it allows stars with sufficient\nmagnetic fields to maintain a fairly stable mass within the galaxies.\n\nSo, from this scenario, we would expect the\nstrength of the magnetic fields around our Sun to be about a thousand times\ngreater than it is actually observed to be, right?\n\nYes, you\ncould be forgiven for thinking that, since in this scenario the magnetic field\nis what is powering the star. But there is something else: the\ndynamo theory also predicts that you should see the same magnetic field\npatterns everywhere we look, even if it is only at the largest scales. That\nmeans that the magnetic patterns, which are generated by the dynamo cycle,\nshould have a length-scale that\u2019s very similar to the length of the solar\nsystem: about 10,000 light-years, if the Sun is the middle of this\ngalactic system.\n\nIn this sense, you could think of the solar\nsystem as being right in the middle of a giant spiral, much like the spiral\nof a galactic disk. And if some stars within that spiral are being powered\nby dynamo processes, then we should see the same strength of magnetic fields\neverywhere.\n\nAnd that is exactly what is observed in the\ngalaxies. What is more, the magnetic fields all over the\ngalaxy seem to have a strength about a thousand times that of the Sun\u2019s. This\nis strong evidence for the existence of dynamo processes and their effect on\nstars.\n\nThis also tells us that the dynamo processes\nare very efficient at generating these magnetic fields, since the field\npatterns are so uniform. It may be that their very regularity is the reason why\nwe don\u2019t see much sign of turbulence in our solar neighborhood, despite\nthe fact that turbulence can disrupt dynamo action. We will investigate this\nfurther in a future article.\n\nBut we have one more piece of important information\nwhich only becomes apparent if we understand the Sun\u2019s magnetic field far\nbetter than we currently do. We know that the Sun\u2019s strong magnetic field\narises from dynamo processes that have been working for a long time. The\nSun\u2019s magnetic field is a mixture of two different magnetic geometries: a\nprimordial field generated as the Sun was forming, and a much smaller-scale\nfield generated by a cycle of magnetic reconnection. At least a few solar\ncycles ago, the latter magnetic field was generated by a huge loop of\nmagnetic field, called the helmet streamer, which stretched over\nthe Sun\u2019s entire surface. A huge number of tiny \u201cmicro-instabilities\u201d\nwithin that loop sparked off small reconnections which produced a great deal of\nenergy each time they occurred. And this was enough to power the Sun with\nenough luminosity to create a solar wind, which in turn provided the\nenergised particles required to drive the heliospheric dynamo: the solar wind\npowered the Sun\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nA recent paper by Chatterjee&Lai (2016) has now analysed magnetic fields in the Sun from the inside\nout, using helioseismology to infer the details of the Sun\u2019s convective\nplumes. They find that the Sun\u2019s magnetic field is \u201cpatchy\u201d. When they look at magnetic fields in sunspots, they find something else:\nthey find sunspot magnetic fields to be quite strongly toroidal fields. That\nis, the sunspots are associated with strong concentrations of twisted field\nlines called \u201ctorsions\u201d.\n\nAnd this means we should start to consider the Sun in\nthe context of a dynamo, because, as\npreviously stated, a dynamo is a machine that converts energy into energy.\nAnd the Sun converts huge amounts of solar energy into energy in the form of\nheliospheric winds and the magnetic field. This process is the source of the\nenergy necessary to power the Sun\u2019s dynamo and the magnetism in the stars that\nwe see around us. But to make the magnetic fields of stars, the Sun\u2019s dynamo\nmust work efficiently.\n\nThe Sun has now had over a billion years to adapt its magnetic field\nto the evolution of its convective pattern, and it is only the most recent\ngeneration of dynamo activity that is now generating significant magnetic\nfields. So we see that the Sun is generating magnetic fields from its own\nactivity for the first time. And it\u2019s generating them quite strongly, since as\n", "label": 1, "id": 100561}

However, these facts only inform us about the *consequence* of accepting the sentence, which in turn also depends on *the context in which* we have accepted the sentence. What does not happen is to see and relate it to a *semantic* state of affairs of the speaker and hearer at a given instant of time. On the contrary, a *content* or *world view* of a sentence tells us what a speaker is actually thinking about when she accepts, or does not accept, the sentence in question, or that is, *its semantic nature*.\\\nAs we learn to know more about an object we make progress in *understanding that object*; the word *understanding* denotes the ability to relate and comprehend a state of affairs of an object or event (for a definition of *understanding* see [@Swin48]). Understanding is *not* a matter of logic alone; it is also a matter of *context*. We understand not only because we have the right logic to make a statement true, but also because we know, in a more or less detailed way, how the object or event is true. In sum: *We understand something because we know the semantic context* that makes that something or that which seems to be a thing true. Knowing a semantic context means knowing the state of affairs that are the consequences of the logical truth of a statement and understanding a sentence means knowing the semantic consequences of accepting the sentence in question. Knowing a semantic context is, among other things, knowing *how* things are (in the sense of Aristotle) since knowing something is a matter of seeing how it is. It is important to notice that knowing is not a trivial matter but rather it requires us to build up our knowledge of the semantics (or semantics) of our world.\\\nThis simple but important remark has to be taken into account when studying the knowledge of natural languages. Indeed, we humans know what there really is and what seems to be true, as long as a semantic context is known to us. Hence, we have *semantic access* to the world, that is to say, it is our business to know the world *semantically*.\\\nWe make progress in this *semantic view on things* or *world view*, which consists of *knowing* that there *are* such and such objects, that such and such events happen, etc. We never gain *ontological knowledge* because nothing *is*; what we *know* is always in the context of the world in which we *know* it; there is no \u201creality\" in a certain sense. The world is only what is \u201cthere\", or in context, within the limits of what is \u201cthere\".\\\nHow can we learn to build up a world view and to construct the models of knowledge we need for a correct understanding of our universe and for a semantic view of things? When we do not \u201cknow\", our model of the world is limited. Knowledge also leads us to develop a model of knowledge. By *model of knowledge* one can understand a *hypothetical model of a system that one has decided to investigate and to understand on the basis of the observations of a certain situation*.\\\nIn a model, one assumes that there is a given state of things (*context*) and then one determines the implications that one can establish from the given state of things (from our knowledge of them), that is, which implications follow from our knowledge of things in a logically sound way (*implications of the logical truth of our knowledge* ). The result of our investigations are the implications that we consider logical but we also ask the questions of whether they are in accord with our knowledge of things; we *test* these implications for truth. Our task is to find out whether these implications, if true, imply as yet something that is not in harmony with our knowledge of things. Thus, the *logical structure* of a model gives us a means to *test hypotheses* and to *test beliefs on a logical level*. In sum, a model of the world gives us a means to *test hypotheses", "label": 1, "id": 100568}

We\u2019re proud to show it to Edinburgh audiences at such a vital time for us.\u201d\n\nThe story is adapted to the cabaret format to be performed for two shows per day, and will be accompanied by a bar and a cast of amateur actors.\n\nThe performance will show the audience a picture of who Mary Barton truly was as they discover her life, and the true story behind the name, which comes from a legend that Mary was cursed to live for 100 years in this shape (with her head always looking into the distance).\n\nThe three performers will explore the history and legends behind a character they will perform alongside for the rest of their careers. Melissa Smith said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working together for nearly three months. We\u2019ve been really excited about the story and the opportunity to perform it alongside our long-time collaborators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to tell her story, and it\u2019s a privilege to be at the fringe festival showing her story.\u201d\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Mary\u2019s Barton \u2013 Cirk La Rose Theatre will be at the Cirk La Rose Theatre during the Edinburgh Fringe 2016 season.\n\nThis story is told by an 18th-century factory-girl who becomes a philanthropist and the Cirk La Rose Theatre is excited to be working with Dolls to tell the story of Mary Barton\u2019s story, with two shows on Wednesday 25 September at 7.30pm and Wednesday 1 August at 9.30pm.\n\nIt\u2019s a real privilege to work in partnership with such a prestigious and historic theatre, and we hope that our partnership will create opportunities for exciting collaborations.\n\nWith two performances a day, Dolls will tell Mary\u2019s story throughout the festival including at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, on Sunday 10 June, at 7.30pm and on Tuesday 13 July, at 8.30pm.\n\nThe story of Mary Barton is fascinating as it follows the rise of a factory-child to become a wealthy philanthropist.\n\nThe Fringe review: For me there were a few stand-outs at the Cirk La Rose Theatre. But it is Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre\u2019s performance of Dolls that I will remember most.\n\nThe Cirk La Rose \u2013 Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre\n\nMelissa Smith, Dolls \u2013 Zoe Stapleford, Dolls\n\nEmily Widdows, Dolls\n\nZoe Stapleford and Melissa Smith\n\nMary\u2019s Barton \u2013 Dolls\n\nMelissa Smith and Zoe Stapleford\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre \u2013 Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre \u2013 Edinburgh Fringe 2016\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre is delighted to present Mary\u2019s Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre \u2013 a production by Dolls presented by Melissa Smith, Zoe Stapleford, Emily Widdows.\n\nDirected by Anna-Louise Jupp, the show will be performed at the Cirk La Rose Theatre, 5 South Bridge, from Friday 25 September 2016.\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre is Edinburgh\u2019s favourite destination theatre within easy walking distance of the historic Scottish Parliament, New Town and Bruntsfield Links Golf Course.\n\nThe Cirk La Rose Theatre hosts more than 600 live shows a year, including everything from touring productions, original Scottish works to well-known and exciting touring shows by internationally recognised theatre companies such as: Aladdin, Les Miserables, Starry St. Mary\u2019s, Jersey Boys, Macbeth, War Horse, The Little Shop Of Horrors, Beautiful People, Chicago The Musical and Fiddler On The Roof.\n\nMary\u2019s Barton will be their first appearance at the Cirk La Rose Theatre.\n\nTo mark their second appearance, the Cirk La", "label": 1, "id": 100569}
{"text": "Yelp ratings for such restaurants can increase sell-out evenings by nearly 20% on average, and increase revenues per evening by more than two-thirds. Yelp is not just for diners and reviewers, and its potential for non-food related businesses is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisees can be successful by creating or sourcing a product that others are happy to pay money for. The biggest mistakes franchisees make are underestimating the effort required and over-happily assuming that they know everything a potential franchisee should. This might be as simple as sourcing the best ingredients or it could be running a successful operations or marketing department.\n\nAn operation/service franchise can be used as a proven business model to solve and monetize a problem. The business model is based on the fact that people pay money for services and/or products that are being bought in their absence by someone they trust. The model has been proven for decades, as pizza chains, delivery services, and restaurants are the oldest examples. Today, we know that social proof can work as well as good old advertising.\n\nThe potential of businesses such as restaurants or cafes are very high. There are no real boundaries to what can be offered, as most of what we buy and use is not manufactured by someone else, but produced right there and then. As such, if an industry is worth $10 trillion dollars and has an annual growth rate of 3% each year, it will grow nearly 100x in size from today to 2030. Yet, there is still a lack of quality information available about how to make the leap from opening a business that is profitable today to a one where the first year is break-even and then becomes stable over time.\n\nOne of the great things about being a business is being able to take a problem and put some money to solving it. The franchise model offers the opportunity to offer a service or even a physical product that solves a problem and is trusted by consumers, without necessarily starting from scratch. This is especially relevant for start-ups who don't have time to wait for an established franchise to start offering the same product. Instead these start-ups can simply use a proven business model to offer the product as their own.\n\nToday, there is a massive demand for new restaurants, but an overabundance of unfulfilled supply. As a result, opening a new restaurant is challenging. There are only so many places where the restaurant and location are right for your business. The other obstacle is time. You need a combination of time and money to get yourself into a position where business is growing and your costs are stabilizing. This gives you a very small margin on which you can operate.\n\nThe biggest mistake that franchisees make is to underestimate the effort that leads up to this critical stage. This is where having a mentor or a mastermind can be invaluable. You will need someone to walk you through the process of starting your business. You might need someone to provide you all available information on the industry, the industry's challenges or opportunities, what is working and what is not (or how to optimize it), and so on. This is called mentorship and mastermind coaching.\n\nAnother mistake that franchisees make is to underestimate how much money and time it takes to run a good operations or marketing department. The cost of hiring a full-time marketing director or operations manager is a lot of money. Even then, a startup can have a decent marketing team or operations team for a little less than a year. Then, if they make a mistake that slows down growth, they are then forced to either cut people or increase margins to stay afloat. This can be a vicious circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, when I started my last startup, I hired a marketing director, who was hired almost five years ago. She was a full-time employee. A year ago, for the second year of her employment, I replaced her with a full-time employee in-house. This freed up a lot of money for me to put into other areas. This was an efficient use of money and time.\nWhat if the problem is something much simpler? Perhaps the key is an efficient solution for that business problem.\n\nHow can you do this on your own? In my opinion, there are many advantages to joining a franchise. Among all the disadvantages, one of the biggest is that it can be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nLet's start with the cost. I estimate that a new franchisee opening, say a coffee shop, costs around $80,000 to $100,000, including the real estate portion, the business license, the food safety certificate, inventory, inventory software, delivery service, marketing, operations, and so on. That's not even taking into account startup fees, which are usually high, of course.\n\nFranchisee\n\nCosts\n\nCoffee Shop\n\n$80,000 to $100,000\n\nReal Estate\n\n$20,000", "label": 1, "id": 100570}

On the sixth, seventh and eighth rows, the first six, seven and eight combs are found in regular intervals, respectively. On each row, the eight combs are closely aligned to the one next to them. The central combs of the eighth row are also on a high plane and their number, usually two (6), can be distinguished from above or below the animal, when examining it from above or below respectively (7). The median antennae reach well beyond the front edge of the animal (8). The eyes are on the front edge between the front-most pair of frontal tentacles.\n\nThe frontal tentacles are long, slender and covered with sensilla on the tips: short- or long-curved filiform, short- or long-barbed, or medium-bearing. Long and medium sensilla also occur on the margin of the two largest lateral tentacles. Medium sensilla (9, 10) have pointed tips bearing a short curved bar (9+). The diameter of a medium sensillum is similar to the diameter of the large lateral tentacle. As usual, large sensilla occur on the tips of lateral tentacles and they are short, filiform, barbed, of medium size, i.e. the length of the bar is equal to or greater than the diameter of the sensillum. On the abcaulus of the frontal tentacles, sensilla are long and filiform (11), but there is an additional row near the apex of the tentacle, with sensilla short and filiform (6), like those of the medial tentacles (12, 13).\n\nLateral tentacles are long, and covered with sensilla on the tips of the two rows of small pointed lobules that are present on their tentacles (14, 15). The second and larger row has a high plane, but the first one is on a lower plane, with tentacles of medium size. The distance between two small pointed lobules of the main row is twice that between two lobules of the second one.\n\nAbcaulus have sensilla on the tips (16), and the tips of the main body of lateral tentacles have short, barbed sensilla (17) and the tip of the small ones have a pointed structure similar to those of the main row on the lateral tentacula. On the margin of the two lateral tentacles, sensilla of short (9), medium (10) and long (18) types are present.\n\nMesosoma\n\nNo spinous plates are present and there is a strong muscular bulge on the ventral surface. The lateral edges of the mesosoma are also thickened.\n\nThe anterior edges of meso- and metasomal segments appear thickened. However, those of the second and third segments do not reach the base of the setae, which are rather wide and long. Dorsal setae are long, but not as long as those of the second and third pair. The length of the lateral ones is equal to that of the medial ones.\n\nMetasomal segment III has the coxa with the dorsal surface smooth, medially slightly convex and with six lateral teeth. Femora are long and slender, but not as long as those of the first pair. Length of the second pair is nearly equal to that of the first. Dorsum of metasomal segment III has a broad basal area, followed by a short, slightly wider portion. All trochanters and tibiae have medium-sized sensilla. Femora are very long for the length of metatarsus, and the latter is slightly longer than wide. Metatarsus are long and slender, bearing long setae covering all the trochantral area. Pores are very similar to those of the first pair.\n\nSkins\n\nAll skin areas bear very numerous seta. Dorsal skin of the trunk has small sensilla on all the points. Sensilla of the second and third pair of segmental edges are short. In addition, three pairs of long seta are found next to the two lateral ones (19). Those of the first pair bear a short, barbed shaft (20, 21). Setae on the surface of the third and fourth pairs are shorter and longer, respectively, than those of the first pair.\n\nPosterior skin is covered with large rounded setae and a few shorter ones. Setae of the first pair are short and barbed, of medium length. Those on the second pair are longer, but not as long as those of the first. Small sensilla are found near the tips of the long lateral setae of posterior-most segment. Some lateral setae (22, 23) are long and barbed, but others are filiform,", "label": 1, "id": 100571}
{"text": "This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the genre from a few decades back and still manages to raise the standard. This is in no way a remake of the original, as many people assume. While I don't remember what exactly the original plot was, it had a good story and it was a nice contrast to be a part of a modern-day suburb. You have your own town, and it has its own story, but the story of this film is different. The residents are much more active in their lives. The story also has a deeper sense of humor (which isn't a bad thing as far as I'm concerned.) I like being a part of a community, but I like doing things outside of that. With this, I was more than happy to sit in my front room and watch the events unfold in the middle of everything. The set pieces of the house are also a sight to behold. I really appreciate that everything looks so close to home, and I believe it's much easier for someone who is not used to this house to believe that it was all their own house. This film really puts people away when it comes to creating something that is terrifying and interesting. It is easy to get caught up in what is actually going on in the house, as everything was so convincing.

And even the other part is really a subset of climate-change issues that the U.S. is very active in because the U.S. is a big contributor. The fact that we have the world's largest economy is a big part of what's driving the climate challenge.\n\nSo while it will be very focused on the economic part of it, part of it will be some focus on the other challenges, as well. And in addition to those challenges, there are \u2014 this will, again, lead to a discussion of the future. Because the biggest problem with climate change, as you know, is that it's not something that can be dealt with by a technology that's here right now. We have to deal with it over a 20- to 30-year period where if we deal with it right now, it could have very serious consequences. So we're going to focus on that as well. The other challenge we're faced with now \u2014 and there really are two aspects to the climate challenge, because the climate challenge is about two important topics: one is energy and the issue about how the world is getting energy, and the other about land. So it's energy first and then land.\n\nWe'll talk about these in order and then move on to the third program, which is the fourth program today. We'll look at what's going on in the U.K., since some of you may have seen the U.K. climate-change bill. We'll see how it's been dealt with over there, as well as the discussion about energy there and what the impact of that is from an economic standpoint.\n\nSo the third program, the fourth, then we'll move on to what's happening in China, because we have so many friends and contacts in China. I was just meeting with a Chinese colleague last week, and \u2014 so that's our third program. The fourth one will be the development of the climate-change agenda for this meeting, and how do we move ahead from here. We'll talk about the future in terms of what can be done and how to go forward. So again, this is the most intense, I think, in terms of talking about these two big \u2014 these two big challenges of climate change.

Maybe some of you are coming, some of you aren't coming, so we'll try to have a discussion among the four of us about what needs to happen and how to do it.

{"text": "At the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in biotechnology were made with the discovery of genetic principles during the work on bacteriophages. Biotechnology evolved from phage therapy to gene therapy to recombinant (r) protein technology^[@CR2],\\ [@CR3]^. Currently, proteins are important bioproducts but also have significant contributions to molecular diagnostics. In fact, with only a few examples^[@CR4]--[@CR6]^, applications of proteins in diagnostic technology have been developed and continue to be developed. In general, protein-based technology is superior to any other alternative method; however, it has major limitations. Proteins are generally produced by *in vitro* or by recombinant (r) DNA technologies in *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) cells. This bacterial host is also used to produce r-proteins, which are more soluble and easier to use than human-derived proteins^[@CR1],\\ [@CR2]^. Recombinant (r) protein production in *E. coli* cells is well-established, with some differences between *E. coli* and human cell lines^[@CR7]^. *E. coli* cells are prokaryotes, which have a smaller genome compared with both eukaryotes, such as mammalian cells, and a larger proteome than unicellular organisms^[@CR8]^. The expression of foreign proteins into living (proto)cells is, however, a challenging and challenging task for protein production.\n\nWhile *E. coli* cells may contain other species that share their genetic code, such as *Saccharomyces cereviciae* and *Saccharomyces bayanus*, most proteins can function in both *E. coli* and *S. cereviciae* cells. The reason for this is that codons in the two genomes have a high level of identity^[@CR1],\\ [@CR7]^. A similar situation exists for expression in mammalian cells, but mammalian codon usage is different from *E. coli* and *S. cereviciae* cell lines, and this can make translation inefficient in these cell lines^[@CR7],\\ [@CR9]^.\n\nA high rate of protein production and a high level of codon identity is important to reduce the size of the expression cassette. Many of these cells have a large genome^[@CR8]^, making the production process more challenging, especially for large amounts of protein product. The size of a standard protein is between 70\u2009kDa and 1\u2009MDa whereas bacteria may contain up to 10^8^ copies of a gene, and for mammalian cells there are only two orders of magnitude between proteins of different molecular weight^[@CR7],\\ [@CR9]^. For recombinant DNA technology to improve the production of proteins in *E. coli* cells, there is a need to develop improved systems for protein and nucleic acid expression. The two main approaches that are currently used to increase protein production in bacteria are protein engineering and host-vector systems.\n\nCurrent strategies in protein engineering use directed evolution for improved proteins^[@CR10]^. Directed evolution is the process by which a protein is evolved to have new or improved properties. This can be accomplished over the course of a few generations. The main advantage of such methods is that this can be accomplished without genetic modification of the cell (mutation). The current use of directed evolution in synthetic biology is to use DNA shuffling, which may involve recombination of multiple genes within a genome. This approach is based on the fact that genes with similar function might share similarity in their protein structures in the central pore; which makes them interchangeable^[@CR11]^. This can be achieved by combining the DNA sequences, even distantly-related coding sequences, into recombinants. Directed evolution (evolution *in vivo*) differs from standard Darwin's theory of natural selection for evolution, and is also different from classical recombination^[@CR12]^. This method in recombinant DNA is more than just shuffling fragments to increase expression in the cells^[@CR13]^. In fact, directed evolution is an important tool in functional genomics^[@CR14]^. Directed evolution (or mutagenesis) involves the amplification of genetic information, selection of the best genes, recombination followed by evolution of the selected genes, or a combination of the two methods^[@CR10]^.\n\nThe use of directed evolution in the selection, recombination and evolution of nucleic acid sequences followed by synthesis of recombinants is a promising method to be used for synthetic biology applications^[@CR10]^. For this purpose, a high level of codon similarity must be introduced into the nucleic acid sequences", "label": 1, "id": 100574}
{"text": "uric acid ( ua ) is the end product of purine metabolism and is released to the blood stream from the cells lining the urinary tract. It is secreted mainly by proximal tubule cells of the proximal tubular epithelium. Ua excretion occurs mainly in the urine in response to metabolic and dietary stimuli.\n\nUa excretion is regulated by a tubular response known as the Fanconi syndrome. The tubular response is triggered by decreased activity in proximal tubular cells, which is associated with inhibition of ureagenesis as a result of a decrease in the rate of de novo synthesis of urea as a purine metabolite and reduced ammonia conversion into urea \\[[@b26-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The tubular response results in decreased reabsorption of ua in the proximal tubule, leading to increased urinary excretions of ua. In a patient with a normal kidney function in the absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a decrease in de novo purine synthesis occurs as a result of decreased purine intake or a decrease in the activity of the purine enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) \\[[@b26-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The purine catabolism leads to decreased urea synthesis by proximal tubular cells as a result of a low level of uric acid production, with an appropriate reabsorption of ua from the urine \\[[@b28-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\].\n\nIn humans, uric acid (ua) excretion exceeds its production, and the production of urea is increased in the uremic individual. The tubular response to CKD is considered to be an effective adaptive mechanism. However increased ua retention is responsible for tubular injury; it is responsible for acute and chronic renal injury \\[[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b29-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The excretion of ua may increase up to 15 times the urinary creatinine excretion in CKD, and it is responsible for the accumulation of uric acid. The role of ua in promoting arterial inflammation is discussed below. The ua/creatinine ratio (UAC) may rise in cases of CKD to levels higher than 10, which constitutes the evidence. Although UAC may rise, a normal UAC usually indicates a normal kidney function \\[[@b30-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b31-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. Therefore, UAC is used as a screening test that can be used to identify renal impairment in asymptomatic patients or in patients with no symptoms.\n\nUA accumulation may be due to enhanced dietary purine intake resulting from inadequate purine restriction for protein intake or due to inadequate excretion of uric acid in patients with a normal creatinine clearance. Hyperuricosuria is generally due to a reduced renal excretion of uric acid. The excretion of uric acid is reduced by up to 70% in patients with chronic renal failure \\[[@b29-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The renal excretion of uric acid is decreased by the absence or dysfunction of proximal tubule cells and by the inability of the kidney to metabolize uric acid under conditions of a reduced purinolytic flux into uric acid.\n\nHyperuricosuria may be asymptomatic or with symptoms of gout or urinary tract stones \\[[@b32-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. Hyperuricosuria in patients with CKD may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary hyperuricosuria, also known as familial juvenile gout, is a congenital or a genetic condition resulting mostly from the genetic abnormality of APRT and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, both of which have an important role in urea synthesis; they are both located in the proximal tubules \\[[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\].

{"text": "the essential feature of weak measurements on quantum systems is that they are designed so that only a small fraction of the overall system undergoes a strong measurement, while the rest of the system is measured weakly. In a weak measurement of a system consisting of an observable $A$ and pointer observable $B$ (see Fig. \\[Fig1\\]), one applies a Hamiltonian to \u201cstir-up\u201d the pointer, leading to an increase of pointer momentum (for which it would typically correspond to a collapse of the pointer observable for the case of position or its conjugate momentum for the case of conjugate momentum measurements). The resulting disturbance in the system, however, is typically a small perturbation due to the weak Hamiltonian and is very small compared with the strong measurement-induced pointer shift. This kind of experiment is generally referred to as a *weak amplification*. Weak measurements can be viewed as the limit of strong measurements when one performs the latter on small subensembles of some initially prepared pointer-particle ensemble [@Aharonov], and they can be regarded as a special case of a more general kind of measurement [@Rosenfeld].\n\nTo quantify the disturbance it is usually expressed as the change of expectation values of the system observable $A$ relative to the case of a standard strong measurement of $A$, typically $\\Delta A = \\langle A \\rangle_{W} -\n\\langle A \\rangle_{S}$ (see also Fig. \\[Fig1\\]). Such a difference is typically small when the pointer-particle is initially prepared in the distribution that realizes $\\langle B\n\\rangle_{S}$ ($\\langle A \\rangle_{S} = \\langle B \\rangle_S$).

{"text": "we study the flux and the angular power spectrum of the [$B$-mode]{}\u00a0 anisotropies produced by cosmic superstrings at the end of inflation as predicted in some specific models.'\n---\n\nIntroduction \u2014\\[sec:Introduction\\]\n=================================\n\nA natural question to address is whether the effects of cosmic superstring networks may have been observed already in the sky. We make the assumption that superstrings did actually form during inflation and discuss such effects. A second question is whether these effects depend on the length of the string, but also on the network size, i.e. the number of intersections on a particular scale, and on the energy of the network. A third question relates to the energy fraction that is in the network, as well as the initial string configurations and the model for the network evolution. We will concentrate on the [$B$-mode]{}\u00a0 [$\\text{C}_\\ell^B$]{}\u00a0anisotropies, which are the dominant contribution to the CMB temperature anisotropies produced by cosmic strings at low angular scales.\\\nIn [@Ade:2013jga], Planck data are interpreted in favour of a lower bound on cosmic superstrings. Using an effective field theory approach to string networks, it is shown that a bound given by $G\\mu/\\alpha'$ of $10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ on $\\alpha'$ yields a limit on $G\\mu$.\\\nIn [@Tasinato:2014tea], authors use a numerical approach, calculating the total energy fraction of cosmic superstrings from a model for the network evolution. The energy fraction is parameterised by the fraction of the string tension $\\mu$ that ends up as cosmic strings when including quantum gravity, $G\\mu$, and a parameter $G\\mu/{N_M}$, where $N_M$ is the number of intersections at a given scale. They calculate the temperature anisotropies for the different initial network configurations, and find that for superstring-derived [$B$-mode]{}s, given the bounds on $\\mu$ and $G\\mu/\\alpha'$, the observed anisotropies can be produced by all the studied scenarios.\\\n\nInitial Conditions from the Energy Fraction of Cosmic Strings\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn what follows, we will give a brief summary of the three aspects, with emphasis on the model for the network evolution. For more details, see [@Hindmarsh:2011qk; @Hindmarsh:2012rc; @Hindmarsh:2012rcB] and [@Hindmarsh:2012rc; @Hindmarsh:2013pg] and references therein.\\\n\n### Initial network configurations \\[sec:IC\\]\n\nThe evolution of the string network on large scales, the evolution relevant for large $\\ell$ modes, is well understood, see e.g. [@Hindmarsh:1994re]. When the string network is formed during a phase transition in the early Universe, the energy fraction will depend on the details of the original phase transition. For example, the energy fraction may depend on the size of the transition, the length of the phase transition and the energy density at the beginning of the phase transition.\\\nA reasonable model for the energy fraction is based on the work of [@Hindmarsh:2011qk]. It was shown that the number of superstrings per Hubble volume on the Hubble scale scales with $\\alpha'$ inversely with an overall scale factor $\\phi$, which, if the string network evolves asymptotically with respect to the Hubble value, implies a non-vanishing final value in a flat Universe, $\\phi=1$. This scale factor corresponds to $\\phi=\\sqrt{\\chi}$, with the density parameter of the Universe, i.e. the Universe was initially matter-dominated, with a string density parameter $\\chi$. Following this logic, it is possible to derive the evolution of the network density, for the different phases of the evolution, when combined with a model for the evolution of the network density over time.\\\nThe basic model is based on a string gas model, $\\rho = \\dfrac{\\mu G}{\\alpha'}\\dfrac{N}{V}$, where $N$ is the total number of strings, $V$ is the Hubble volume, and $\\mu$ is the string tension. The model assumes a constant number $N(t) = G\\dfrac{\\mu(t)}{\\alpha'}$ of strings per Hubble volume, such that the energy density is just $\\rho = G\\mu(t)/\\alpha'$. The model is derived under the assumption that the energy fraction is a constant, but with this model set-up, one", "label": 1, "id": 100578}
{"text": "precise knowledge of x - ray diffraction profile shape is required for the determination of strain). However, if an accurate prediction can be made with the assumption of linear elasticity (as may be the case if the applied strain is in the x-y plane to minimize the effects of nonlinearity) as in Ref.\u00a0\\[\\], that knowledge can be used for strain measurements on films with complex geometry and/or microstructures.\n\nThe stress tensor in a medium has three nonvanishing components, namely, those in the x-y, y-z, and x-z planes. For a thin film, the stress field is usually measured as the x-y component of the total stress field. However, in a composite with a certain number density of the elastic phase, the stress field may be determined from the x-y component of the stress tensor and the total number density of the system, as may be found, for example, in Refs.\u00a0\\[\\]. The x-y component of the stress field should be obtained by dividing the area of the interface between the film and its substrate by the surface area of the substrate (i.e., by the effective area of the interface).\n\nThe Young\u2019s modulus of an isotropic material is characterized by the stress-strain relationship\n\n$$\\label{eq:stressteyn}\n\\varepsilon={\\frac{1}{E}}({\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda}},0,0)$$\n\nwhere the Poisson ratio has been taken as 0.5, and a simple linear dependence of the stress on strain is assumed. The stress-strain relationship is characterized by its material symmetry and dimensions. The material symmetry will, in general, depend on the crystal structure (the symmetry group of the material) and the dimensions will depend on the shape of the sample and the surface of the sample, and the applied strain. For example, if the Young\u2019s modulus is a scalar, the material symmetry will be orthogonal, while if it is a vector, the material symmetry will be orthotropic. In the case of a tensorial relationship between the stress and strain, the symmetry will be more general than that expected for the ideal case. There is also a wide range of geometries where the elastic moduli of thin films have been determined using a variety of techniques (including the techniques applied in this paper) for example, see Ref.\u00a0\\[\\]. There, it is also stated that it would be important to use the Young\u2019s modulus at a given strain to find the strains for the entire range of uniaxial strains needed by a particular technology.\n\nWhen a film is strained, it must first deform elastically before any plastic deformation occurs (if any at all). The deformation is usually governed by the Poisson ratio, which is the ratio of the change in the length of the sample along the two directions parallel to the strain direction and the change in the length of the sample perpendicular to that direction. The Poisson ratio is not a physical parameter and it can have any value depending on the boundary conditions such as, for example, the surface states that are on the surface of the sample, whether the sample can be cut and glued to a suitable holder, whether the sample is a thin film on a surface or something else, etc. In any case, the Poisson ratio of a material for any particular sample geometry can be determined experimentally by applying a strain to the sample (the Poisson ratio is a physical parameter independent of boundary conditions), observing the deformation of the sample, using the aforementioned ratio of the length change in the direction parallel to the strain direction and that perpendicular to the strain direction. The Young\u2019s modulus of the material may be determined from the Poisson ratio using Eqn.\u00a0\\[eq:stressteyn\\]. As indicated above, there is a wide range of Young\u2019s moduli for the same Poisson ratio (due to the Poisson ratio being the ratio of the strain of the material independent of boundary conditions) resulting from variations of both the material and the sample shape, etc.\n\nAlthough it is widely stated that knowledge of the Poisson ratio of a film helps in the determination of Young\u2019s modulus, there is no such statement in the literature. This is because Poisson ratio is a property of the elastic response of the sample (i.e., it is a material parameter as opposed to an experimentally determined property, which would involve, for example, measurements of either the change in sample dimension along strain or the change in sample dimension perpendicular to the strain direction, and the use of the aforementioned ratio of lengths to determine the Poisson ratio), and a Poisson ratio of a sample has nothing to do with the Poisson ratio of the bulk material from which the sample was deposited.

{"text": "Since about the year 2000, a growing number of Internet users have been exchanging messages over the electronic network commonly known as the Internet. The Internet uses the Internet Protocol (xe2x80x9cIPxe2x80x9d) as a network layer protocol. The Internet Protocol enables communication among hosts (also called xe2x80x9cstacksxe2x80x9d) on the network.\nUsers of a stack communicate over the network with other users of the network by exchanging a plurality of packets known as xe2x80x9cpackets.xe2x80x9d The packets contain a plurality of fields, including a header and a data portion. The header contains metadata for the packet, including the destination address of the stack, the origin address of the stack, a sequence number within the stack, the time of reception by the stack, etc. The data portion holds user data, such as a file or image file, and may also contain additional fields.\nIn order to protect against a variety of malicious attacks, users of the network communicate in layered fashion. For example, the transmission control protocol (TCP) provides reliability and provides connection-oriented, sequential handshaking to establish a connection. However, many protocols and applications exist, such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Telnet, which operate without the presence of any reliability or connection-based handshaking mechanisms. On the other hand, other Internet protocols, such as the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), operate without the presence of TCP, or any other connection-oriented protocols.\nThe Internet protocol suite (xe2x80x9cIPSxe2x80x9d) is the collection of protocols defined in the Internet Protocol Standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (xe2x80x9cIETFxe2x80x9d). This IP suite includes the Internet Protocol, Transmission Control Protocol, and various other protocols. The Internet Protocol addresses most of the limitations of the Internet Protocol in providing reliable handshaking procedures. The Internet Protocol has a reliable delivery mechanism or protocol, the transmission control protocol. However, this reliable delivery protocol uses a reliable sequencing protocol, which is problematic in situations where packet sequence numbers are used in reliable connections. Specifically, because reliable connections are connection-based, no reliable sequencing protocol is used by this connection type. This prevents protocols such as FTP, Telnet, and HTTP from being reliably delivered.\nAccordingly, a protocol known as the User Datagram Protocol (xe2x80x9cUDPxe2x80x9d) has been used to permit the reliable handshaking required by reliable connections while eliminating the requirement to sequence packets. However, a number of problems arise when performing reliable connections using the UDP protocol. For example, the reliability of reliable connections does not typically operate as reliably in environments in which there can be intermittent losses of network packets. Further, reliable connections perform differently from connection-oriented protocols, including TCP, because unreliable connections do not generally provide the reliability associated with TCP, such as the ability to recover from network interruptions. Accordingly, in addition to the packet sequencing difficulties associated with reliable connections, reliable connections are subject to a different set of problems not seen in connection-oriented connections. These problems include problems associated with the different delivery modes of the unreliable protocol, the UDP.\nIn a reliable connection, such as a connection that follows the TCP protocol, both the transmitting and receiving stack keep track of what has occurred when the transmission of a packet is delayed, such as a temporary packet loss. When this occurs, the stack resends the missing packet. This process is performed on a packet-by-packet basis as each packet is being transmitted and thus, as the sending host encounters packet losses and packet delays, it sends additional packets or retransmits particular packets. The transmitting stack knows to send additional packets only upon a specified number of packet losses for a certain number of packets have been encountered.\nFor example, under the TCP protocol, a retransmission timer (xe2x80x9cRTOxe2x80x9d) is generally set equal to a constant of about 125 seconds. If the RTO expires, the transmitting stack will resend the packets that have gone missing. Because the receiving stack must be prepared to receive packets from many different hosts, not every packet is sent by the transmitting stack upon the RTO expiry. Instead, the stack waits for a specified period of time until the stack believes its buffers are free enough to start transmitting packets.\nIn an unreliable connection, such as a connection using the UDP protocol, the transmitting stack simply sends the packets it wishes to send, regardless of a delay in the delivery of the packets. As noted earlier, the transmission control protocol protocol (TCP) generally does not operate in asynchronous fashion. Rather, for every packet, the host maintains the same packet sequencing as packets from another host, and the", "label": 1, "id": 100580}
{"text": "This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting is top notch, everything is in order. What is lacking here is the emotional depth of the novel, as you mentioned. But that is a fault of all adaptations.\n\nThere are many good directors (among them, Bergman, Cassavetes, etc.) who\u2019ve taken on these adaptations and, by sheer talent, have actually achieved a good result. The problem for me, is that while adapting the material, they had the desire to please (and they did that, of course) and therefore, some aspects of the novel were altered, changed or lost entirely.\n\nThe director, who\u2019s not mentioned above, didn\u2019t lose or change as much as some others did but he still took away things from the material to make it into a more \u201caccessible\u201d or \u201cpolished\u201d film. That is not so much a problem because when he was \u201cpasting on\u201d aspects of the novel in the script, that is what they added in, not what would be the proper \u201cspirit of the material\u201d. However, he still made many changes to the novel, as you mentioned.\n\nIt is difficult if not impossible to completely recreate a novel (whether on a big or small screen) for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, most of the novels you will find in this sub-genre are rather complex, sometimes to the point where it becomes impossibly hard to find an \u201call encompassing\u201d version of the work.\n\nSecondly, the director will often decide to change some of the things or make it more \u201ccommercial\u201d, regardless of any logic in the book the writer has conceived in writing the book. That is just the way of the director and his or her opinion. What a director thinks needs to be changed or added in a film (especially on the big screen) will not be the most appealing thing for all audiences. It\u2019s for these reasons that the novels are rarely, if ever, made into film adaptations and are more likely to be turned into plays (either on stage or in movie theaters) or short films like the one below, which is a nice, short version of \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d.\n\nThirdly, an adaptation of a story like \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d or \u201cThe Idiot\u201d would be simply ridiculous if a lot of the things they change (like the time frame, the names, the locations, etc.) are really insignificant to the story. That\u2019s not the end of the world or something that would necessarily compromise the quality of the adaptation. We are talking, after all, about films and not books. They are stories, made for the big screen.\n\nThis adaptation of \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d is quite the contrary. The story and the story\u2019s essence are pretty much identical to the novel but the director\u2019s changes/alterations are quite drastic (a new title, new end/beginning, new characters, a different time frame, changed endings to the story, new characters with \u201cdifferent\u201d names, etc.).\n\nIn short, the director takes the book and changes a ton of things. However, this doesn\u2019t at all mean that the film is bad. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s really awesome, to the point where I would consider it to be a real (and much lesser used genre) adaptation. Like I said before though, for all it\u2019s greatness, this is not the most faithful version of the material in my opinion. However, if I could make a comparison the film would be akin to \u201cThe Lord of the Flies\u201d (with the same plot). Both are great films with a great director (Orson Wells, and William Wyler), who were able to take a book that had been turned into a popular play and make something from it that was a real (great) film.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t see why one wouldn\u2019t want to have different names. Yes, people might think \u201cthis is an English film!\u201d when they see the title of the film. But, wouldn\u2019t people think (and feel) the same if he would have kept the original title? Sure, Russian names are more common abroad and Russian names are rare around the west. Also, one would not know that the character is from Russia even with the English titles though. Anyway, I just wanted to say that names do count. It\u2019s not as big a problem as you might think for instance with \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nYes, I know they do.

{"text": "special relativity is reformulated as a symmetry property of space (Lorentz group) and energy-momentum (Poincar\u00e9 group). In the new formulation, the relativity principle is defined and expressed as the relation between the velocity of a photon, i.e. the speed of an electromagnetic wave. The relation between the velocity of a photon and its momentum is obtained by requiring the conservation of momentum under the action of the Lorentz group, and using the Lorentz equations of transformation. This yields a general equation for the velocity of a photon.\n\nThe new formulation is compared with the original formulation in special relativity. The advantage of the new formulation with respect to the second formulation is that it only deals with space (symmetry group) and time (Poincar\u00e9 group), whereas the first formulation deals also with energy (Lorentz group).\n\nThe Lorentz invariance of electromagnetic waves suggests that the equations of conservation of energy and momentum could also be formulated in these terms. This leads to new expressions for the energy and momentum of a photon, but only under constraints on the space and the velocity of the photon. The Lorentz symmetry of electromagnetic waves and the energy-momentum formulae obtained in this way make us believe that the new theory is completely legitimate, but a detailed analysis of the general case is beyond our knowledge.\n\nIn the sequel, we focus on a specific problem arising in astrophysics, that is the acceleration of the universe, and which is explained by the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant ([@bib9]). To do this, we start from the fact that the cosmological constant has the dimension of a velocity. It is therefore not a true invariant quantity, but an invariant property of space and time. For the relativistic transformation between two reference frames, where the first is moving at a velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$ in the Minkowski space and the second is at rest in this space, this amounts to the property that the cosmological constant is invariants under the Poincar\u00e9 group, the group of relativity. It is possible to show that the cosmological constant is a scalar under any Lorentz transformations and hence under the $SO(1,3)$ group, the group of relativity. This gives rise to a transformation law for the cosmological constant in the following form:$$\\zeta\\rightarrow\\zeta_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\zeta_{1}$$where $\\zeta$ denotes the cosmological constant in the first reference frame, and $\\zeta_{1}$ the cosmological constant in the second reference frame. The parameter $\\gamma$ represents the Lorentz factor of this transformation and the subscripts indicate the values of the quantities in the first and the second reference frames.\n\nThe transformation law between both reference frames thus assumes the form of Galilean equations combined with the equation for the evolution of the cosmological constant. This form of the problem is then analysed in more details by taking into account the equation for the evolution of the energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological constant thus arises as an inherent property of space and of time through the conservation of energy-momentum, in particular during the evolution of the universe.\n\n### A.2.1. The principle of relativity {#sec3.1.1}\n\nSuppose that $\\mathbf{k}$ and $k$ indicate an observable quantity, which corresponds to a quantum state described by a vector **k**. Let us assume that $R_{s}$ is a vector which corresponds to a property associated with some physical state of some entity. At an individual level, this entity will have different $\\left\\{ \\mathbf{k}\\right\\} $ values during its life. It can then be assumed that an individual entity has different $R_{s}$ values at different instants of time, and in a given frame of reference, depending on its own state at that time. We then assume this $R_{s}$ value to be some function of **k** and of time. For a system of $N$ particles, we then assume $\\mathbf{p}_{i}$ and $p_{i}$ to be respectively the momentum and the energy of each particle. The state of the particles has now to be described by a vector $\\left\\{ \\mathbf{p}_{i},N\\right\\} \\in\\mathbf{R}^{3\\times N}$ at any instant. The *principle of relativity* (PR) is defined by the condition that the value of $p_{i}$ is the same in every inertial reference frame.\n\nThe problem of time is now to determine whether these properties $\\mathbf{k}$", "label": 1, "id": 100585}
{"text": "The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the \u201cliberation of the Muslim mind,\u201d a form of religious freedom that would encourage Muslims to reject repressive ideas such as Islamism. For Taha Abdul-Qadir, the Egyptian member of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Freedom and Justice Party (also a candidate in Sudan\u2019s upcoming elections), the project was part of his party\u2019s broader efforts to challenge the idea that Islam is \u201ca political ideology\u201d that cannot be reformed. \u201cThe Arab world is not a monolith,\u201d he explained, adding that the Muslim Brotherhood is \u201cskeptical of any ideology that restricts the right to criticize religion.\u201d In Syria, Abdul-Qadir had been working to help \u201ccounter the Islamic extremism\u201d in the country by engaging in \u201cdialogs and exchanges,\u201d a strategy he hopes will help Syrians find a \u201cbalanced view of Islam.\u201d\n\nThese were the slogans painted on Abdul-Qadir\u2019s office walls, but the real purpose of the funding is much more complex. According to its website, al-Taqwa\u2019s aim was to assist \u201cyoung Muslims as they challenge what they perceive to be the \u2018deteriorating situation\u2019 in the world.\u201d The website further stated that the funds supported \u201ca movement of young Muslim activists who work to strengthen Islam and the Arab identity.\u201d This is not an uncommon goal among Islamic groups operating outside the US \u2013 indeed, such organizations often target \u201cWestern\u201d donors to their political goals and aspirations. In Syria, such efforts were most likely a response to the Arab Spring. According to interviews Abdul-Qadir and members of his organization gave in 2011 and 2012, they were inspired by the idea of reopening a debate about Islam in the Arab world, at a time when Western values were becoming more dominant and Islam was being discredited.\n\nThese donations were part of a broader strategy to challenge the idea that Islam is a \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d and instead to promote the idea of \u201ca more pluralistic and religiously neutral Islam.\u201d In some ways, it is fitting that such an approach would surface at this time. As the Islamist project has taken root in the Muslim world, the idea of \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d has been discredited. Instead, even many who identify as \u201cMuslims\u201d are forced to choose whether they are liberal, conservative, or more moderate.\n\nThe Syrian and Egyptian branches of Tala\u2019aa also played a role in the funding of their respective groups in other ways. They provided financial assistance for the start-ups of the two organizations \u2013 which meant, for example, that Tala\u2019aa Sudan provided the funding of Tala\u2019aa-Libya. In addition, the Egyptian branch of Tala\u2019aa provided \u201cdonation\u201d money to fund activities in countries where it had members, including Qatar, Palestine, Palestine, Jordan, and Tunisia.\n\nWhen groups are formed, many questions need to be answers, such as how to structure and who can be involved, what is the role of religion in the movement, what are its goals, and more. An important role of a foundation often is to provide start-up money as well as organizational assistance in such matters. For example, when Tala\u2019aa formed in 2008, the Syrian chapter worked for a time without a permanent home until it was able to move into a facility provided by one of the country\u2019s biggest political parties. The Tunisian chapter followed a similar strategy.\n\nTala\u2019aa provides no information about its funders. As discussed in previous reports (see, for example, here and here), a number of groups have been tied to the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas, including the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), the Islamic Corporation Fund (ICF), and the Islamic Charity League (ICL). In addition, Al-Ghuraba is tied to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Alwaleed bin Talal charity because it shares part of its founding with the Riyadh Charitable Organization, which in 2003 was named \u201cthe principal financial instrument of Saudi Aramco.\u201d For example, the Saudi Charitable Organization was created by one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s richest investors, Alwaleed bin Talal.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nThe Egyptian and the Sudanese organizations were able to get their start-up funds from the Tala\u2019aa Foundation, but what will happen to this start-up money now that the groups have become established? Will the funds from the Tala\u2019aa Foundation be enough to meet the costs of activities?\n\nIf Tala\u2019aa\u2019s plan is successful, the Islamic Charity and Support Organization\u2019s work will be replicated in countries throughout the Muslim world.

There it says that \u201cdecisions on fundamental issues taken after [the 1998] Treaty will require Council authorisations.\u201d Thus the Maastricht Treaty did provide the legal basis for subsequent treaties, but not for fundamental decisions, a major deviation from the common understanding.)\n\nNor is the term \u201creform\u201d used in the Treaty of Lisbon2 or the Amsterdam Treaty.3 The Lisbon Treaty contains a provision that says that \u201cthe Union shall make the most efficient and the most effective use of Union resources, including human resources, on the basis of Community priorities, promoting better coordination, complementarity and efficiency, without distorting competition\u201d \u2013 this provision was introduced in the new treaty to ensure democratic approval.4 The Amsterdam Treaty also says that \u201cto strengthen Union effectiveness, its action shall be based on three fundamental principles: \u2018more democracy, better law. more openness, better information.\u2019\u201d It gives very general objectives (such as \u201creform of the working of the European Council\u201d) and broad powers to define how the implementation of the treaty will be (\u201cbased on sound Community priorities\u201d, \u201caimed at enhancing Union effectiveness and at the development of common policies\u201d).\n\nIn sum, and after correcting one mistaken understanding, both the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty do not give any indication of a planned \u201creform\u201d of the Union, nor of an agenda for such a reform, nor of the need for such a reform. The Treaty of Rome, which formed the EU, contains a specific provision giving \u201cthe right to initiate any reform of the treaty,\u201d but there is nothing in that provision to indicate that any such reform is needed or what exactly the reform might be.

The other interesting article this week reviews some different animals, like dinosaurs and whales, who were also in the news.\n\nIf you would like to read more about the stories from the past week and many more, you can find them all listed under Interesting Articles, below.\n\nIt seems like the story everyone wants to hear is, in fact, the end of the world. Whether we\u2019re talking about Biblical prophets, Hollywood movies, or real-life zombie stories, the apocalypse is always a compelling story. In fact, the apocalypse is so popular that it has spawned various other fictional stories, including the very popular video game, The Walking Dead. While this type of apocalyptic story is one that always attracts a great amount of attention, what can we learn from these stories? One thing that becomes apparent, even when viewed from a somewhat different perspective, is that they each point to one common and serious problem: human violence.\n\nThere are many types of human violence, and it comes in all forms: domestic violence, child abuse, gang violence, bullying, terrorism, and to name just a few. However, one commonality is that these forms of human violence all share a common problem: they all feed on social systems.\n\nThe first thing that must be clear before we can understand how social systems feed on human violence, is that we have to understand what human violence is\u2013and what it is not. Human violence is not:\n\nIf there are social systems, then human violence, by its very nature, is not going to exist. If there is no social system, then human violence becomes pointless. Thus, human violence is:\n\nSocial Systems Feed on Human Violence\n\nSo, what is a social system? The word \u201csocial\u201d is not meant to imply there is a \u201chuman society\u201d, which certainly is not the case. It is meant to indicate that there is some social relationship between the social system participants\u2013that is, something inherent to them which makes them interact with others. As individuals with different personalities, desires, and skills, we all have some inborn and learned social patterns. These social patterns are what make us human. Social systems are, then, what we have created\u2013which explains why we have social systems to begin with.\n\nBut, the problem comes when some individual tries to act outside of those social patterns. They may think they are being \u201creal\u201d, but they are in fact acting out of their unique personality and inborn behaviors. This is because of that very unique personality and inborn behaviors\u2013they are not supposed to act out of those unique behaviors in the first place. If they did, there would not be a social pattern in the first place.\n\nNow, these individuals would do well to recall that these very same social systems are there to regulate behavior as well. A social system is set up so that each person will be able to have at least some peace of mind\u2013as well as some ability to flourish, both on personal level as well as societal and collective levels. Human violence is thus, in part, the result of a failure in communication.\n\nHuman violence is usually the result of a situation where, as a society of people, we have created some sort of an artificial social system. The problem comes when some individual does not feel comfortable within the social system because they do not feel that their uniqueness is accepted or taken into account by the system. What then happens is that the individual will look for a way to break that system, whether it is on a personal or societal level.\n\nThis is because the", "label": 1, "id": 100588}

{"text": "results of analytic and numerical investigations of first - passage time problems\n\n\\[subsec:level1\\] Analytical studies\n------------------------------------\n\n### General approach\n\nTo gain some intuitive insight into the problem on hand, let us assume that the underlying stochastic dynamics are such that once a walker \u201clands on\u201d the first node (say node $n$) he never leaves it. (In fact this is true for any node visited by the walker with probability $p$). Then, if the walker \u201clands\u201d on node $n$ the time to reach node $n$ is $T=T_0 + \\sum^{N+1}_{n=1}t_n$. This sum can be rewritten in the following form: $$\\label{eq.3}\n T=T_0+t_{N+1}+  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} t_n = T_0+t_{N+1}+T_{N+1}.$$ Here $T_0=t_1$ is the first hitting times of node $n=1$ in node $n$ and $T_{N+1}=t_{N+1}+T_N$ is the first hitting times of node $n=N$ in node $n=N+1$ for the first node starting from some node $n\\in \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$. Thus\n\n$$\\label{eq.3a}\nT_{N+1} = T_N+b_n$$\n\nwhere $b_n$ and $T_N$ are now defined by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nb_n=t_{N+1} & \\text{ and  } & T_N=t_{N+1}+T_{N-1}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe two nodes starting from $n=1$ ($n=N$) will only meet at node $N+1$ ($n=1$) once the walker takes more than $n-1$ steps to reach the final destination. So the problem is related to the time to reach node $N+1$ starting from node $n$ and the first time to reach $N+1$ starting from node $N$ is the difference between these two times, and since both $b_n$ and $b_{N+1}$ depend only on the number of steps required to reach the final node and so do $T_N$ and $T_{N+1}$. However, if there exists a set of functions of the number of steps $T_n(\\ell)$ and the number of times reaching $N+1$ starting from $N$ $B_n(\\ell)$ such that $$T_{N+1}(\\ell)=T_N(\\ell)+B_n(\\ell)$$ then the problem of searching for $T_{N+1}$ is reduced to search for $B_n$ knowing that $T_{N+1}$ is dependent on the number $\\ell$ of steps $T_{N+1}(\\ell)$. To see how this can be achieved, note that $$\\begin{aligned}\nT_N(n)&=\\left (\\sum^{n}_{k=1}k \\right ) + \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor +\\left \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2} \\right \\rfloor,\n\\label{eq.4}\n\\\\ \nT_n(n)&=n+1 + \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2} \\right \\rfloor.\n\\label{eq.5}\\end{aligned}$$ Thus, $T_N(n) - T_n(n) = \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor$ for $n/2$ is the average number of steps required to reach the final node from node $n$ starting walks from $n/2$. Also we observe that $b_n = \\frac{T_N(n)-T_n(n)}{2}$ for $4n>T_n(n)$.

In section 3 we have analyzed the dependence of critical properties of quark-quark-meson system on different parameters of the problem to search the region of confinement phase transition in the phase diagram of the system. The discussion of the results is contained in sec.4.\n\nCalculation setup\n=================\n\nWe used the standard Lattice QCD Monte Carlo approach to study the system under consideration. Our simulations correspond to the lattices with $L_T=32,64$ spatial sites and temporal extent of $N_{t}=10,20$. We used the Wilson action for non-compact formulation of the fermions with the bare coupling $1/g^2=0.70,0.75,0.84,0.90$ at $\\beta=2.6,2.7$ and 2.8. We employed a hybrid algorithm in order to use large lattices to simulate light quarks with chirally invariant fermions and large lattices to simulate heavy quarks with chirally non-invariant fermions on one time slice [@Fernandez:2012]. We computed the observables at fixed $u=s$ (quark mass) and checked for their independence on the total quark mass in order to verify the system on the border of chiral symmetry. Quark masses were chosen so that the corresponding pions are massless. We are interested in the thermodynamics of light quarks with vanishing chemical potential at which we should look for the transitions between different phases of the matter i.e. chiral and confinement. Therefore the physical quark masses were adjusted to be $m_{ud}=m_{s}$ and the light and heavy quark masses were set to be proportional to these quark masses, $m_{u}=m_{s}m_{Q}$ and $m_{d}=m_{s}m_{Q}$ with $m_{Q}/m_{s}>1$, since the light quark mass is much less than the strange quark and heavy quark mass. The light quark $q=(u,d)$ is usually considered massless, $m_{q}=0.005$, but we also considered finite $m_{q}$. In this way we consider the transition from the confined light quarks phase into the deconfined phase. The confinement is realized by the massless chiral fermions at $m_{ud}=m_{s}=0.005$. The number of configurations for the light quark and mesons is collected, in total, above 100000 at $N_{t}=10,20$.\n\nThe calculation of the observables on the lattice and the definition of the model parameter $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ are performed in following way. The fermionic action $S_{q}$ is modified in [@Aharony:2003sx] by the term $$S_{d} = r \\delta r \\bar \\psi_{s}^3\\psi_{s}^3+ \\alpha_{min}^{s} r^2(\\bar \\psi_{q}^3\\psi_{q}^1-\\bar \\psi_{q}^1\\psi_{q}^3)^2$$\n\nThe physical quark mass $m_{s}=0.0005$ is kept fixed and the bare coupling $r$ is tuned in the interval $0.2 \\le r \\le 2.7$ for the four $\\beta$ values. The parameter $r$ reflects the strength of the mixed lattice mesonic couplings, while $\\alpha_{min}^{s}$ determines the amount of the mixed fermionic couplings. The renormalised mixed coupling constant $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ is kept fixed in the region $0.0 \\le \\alpha \\le 0.3$ depending on the $r$ value, for each $\\beta$ value and $N_{t}=10,20$. The value of $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ for the $r =0$ gives the result of the pure lattice model. At this stage one needs to fix the parameter $\\beta_c$. We consider two values, namely $\\beta_c=1.95$ and $\\beta_c=2.17$ where the transition to hadronic phase occurs smoothly, respectively, for $N_{t}=10,20$. At $\\beta=2.6$, for instance, it will be realized for $r=0.4,\\alpha=0.04.$ The bare quark mass $m_{q}^0$ in this case was set to be equal $0.005$ independently", "label": 1, "id": 100592}
{"text": "This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. I'm so pissed.\n\nThere are a few things though. The first is that it was a perfect storm of good and bad. The idea was fine, but the writing was bad, the plot was bad, the characters were bad. There's a character in this movie called Gail Dern (who I feel really bad for. She got one thing right, what she was going for with that film. But she's got a voice about a hundred years too old. It's not her fault people don't like her, but it's a tough voice.) And she was the catalyst of all the disaster to set up the revenge plot. It was supposed to be Gail who the audience was supposed to sympathize with and then love after she lost her dog, and ended up dying. But it was just such a failure of character. It just came out like a random decision when Gail went home and she'd been working so long on the film and she needed a break and she stopped. You know, it didn't feel right. The script that's supposed to have the big twist ending, where the family goes to the park and sees the dead bodies, doesn't have it in there. I love how it was just like on the end credits, they said, \"In the park scene where people came home from the film and said, 'Oh, that scene where they see the dead bodies on the news?'\" \"Oh...\" \"No.\" \"OK, that was one of our big twists. We said, 'Well, if you knew then, what if you just went and saw it?'\" And I was like, right there's the whole movie you missed seeing 'cause you stopped the movie there.\n\nA good example of the plot being bad is that there was a real plot that a little boy (who's played by that kid, Michael Haneke (from Amelie). I forget his name.) steals his dog, and his big revenge in his movie of the week, his revenge on the town that hates him and his dad for beating up his dog, and all he wants to do is give the kid back his dog. He wants to give it back 'cause he's innocent and everything....\n\nNo, he doesn't. And he brings the police with him to the big town that hated him, and the kid makes him take a lie detector test. He passes the test 'cause he gets to the end of the lie detector test and the film just cuts directly to him saying \"Well, I just wanted to prove that I could get away with it. So, you know, I thought, 'They'll probably just let it go.'\" And the audience doesn't know it's a lie detector test, so they have to be like that's not how it works.\n\nSo the plot is bad, and the voice was out of place, and some of the other things about it that made it just so bad. And it's like I just don't want it to not be a movie, even a bad movie. It was like a bad movie that you just couldn't take your eyes off of because it was just so bizarre. But I just wanted to watch it so I could laugh at it. I think like I said the bad thing about not being able to watch it is not being able to laugh at it. So I'd like to see this movie again.\n\nAlso, I don't think I hate a director that much anymore. I'm so scared of hating this many directors again. We're all probably still at the same spot, so I don't know what to do with this. I liked that one, The Collector, I've liked this one before, Happy End. I know that there are bad ones and great ones and bad ones. And I'm so scared of making that list. Or the other movie I just watched, the very, very bad, bad, bad movie is the last 10 minutes of the movie where you're just like, oh, that was so horrible. You know, that was the part I was waiting for. The bit where they really fall over the cliff into the water and you're like, \"Oh, that was so horrible.\" And it's the best of the movie.\n\nBut I really was waiting for that bit to just happen, and it didn't. In fact, it was better in a way, it was over with before it'd be as bad as it had to be for it...that was the opposite.\n\nThursday, November 19, 2004\n\nI know I already used that title. But I wanted to call this week \"A month of weirdness\" because what's happened this week in my life is weird. So this week, some strange stuff has happened.

{"text": "It's almost certainly too early to say that the Arizona economy will be \"reborn,\" but a few interesting things have happened in the first month of 2014 in Mesa, the state's largest city, and its county, Maricopa (Phoenix is, and has been, a separate city). It's early, it's small, and the numbers aren't necessarily scientific \u2014 but they aren't random, either, so I will tell you what they are.\n\nFirst, the numbers about jobs:\n\nThere are 930 fewer jobs in Mesa itself.\n\nThere are 564 more jobs in Maricopa.\n\nIf you're wondering which county is growing faster, that's not likely to be too complicated: Arizona Central looks at Maricopa's growth first and foremost (because it's growing, and the other counties of Maricopa County all want jobs as well, and they are less likely to grow).\n\nThere are fewer jobs.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that there are fewer people working. There are fewer people in the workforce, perhaps; Arizona's birth rate is dropping, for one thing. But we shouldn't be too surprised \u2014 we've had jobs growth in Phoenix, which has the greater urban population. And that isn't going to increase. It's going to decline (unless immigration increases). But it's going to be hard to grow again; the recovery's not there yet (see chart below).\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale jobs growth\n\nCity-county\n\nJan 2013\n\nJan 2014\n\nSource: Arizona Regional Transit Plan\n\nPhoenix\n\n12,000\n\n12,100\n\nMaricopa\n\n5,900\n\n6,500\n\nThe last two years have been great years for Maricopa County, and especially for Mesa County. They were a little better, in the last year or so, but not too much. Maricopa is actually the economic strength for the region, so it's a bit of a disappointment to see that strength wane. It is likely not too long until Phoenix and Tempe are no longer the economic power for the region: that's already partly happened.\n\nIt's also unclear if the local governments can keep up that pace; it is a small city, so it's not easy to \"catch up\" to Phoenix and then hold on to that position after a decade or so, or when Phoenix starts recovering.\n\nSo we should expect to see further job growth in other cities and cities in Maricopa County, especially once the national recovery really gets going.\n\nThere are fewer jobs in the private sector in Mesa.\n\nThe city's decline in private sector jobs is partly due to our larger population (population growth is not necessarily economic growth), but in Maricopa County in the last decade or two, the private sector jobs have moved from the big cities to the far suburbs, to allow the county's suburban population to grow as Phoenix started to recover:\n\nTotal\n\nJan 2013\n\nJan 2014\n\nSource: Arizona Regional Transit Plan\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan area\n\nMesa\n\nMaricopa\n\nPrivate sector jobs\n\n5,000\n\n6,100\n\nMesa County\n\n8,800\n\n8,900\n\nTotal\n\nPrivate sector\n\n14,100\n\n15,100\n\nTotal\n\n24,200\n\n26,200\n\nAs Arizona Central has reported before, the suburban growth is now part of the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale area, and has a fairly strong employment boost as a result. Not only is the suburban population growing, but it's growing relatively fast (a few percentage points per year), and it's mostly white (a relatively conservative group). The suburbs' population growth is likely to be somewhat more sustainable, but Maricopa's strong growth rate doesn't necessarily transfer over to its suburbs.\n\nBut, again, Maricopa County is likely to grow faster than the Phoenix area. And the suburbs are, for now, growing faster than Mesa \u2014 a sign that the Phoenix Metro Area is not yet at full employment, and perhaps not close to that. (It's possible that our Phoenix Metro Area's employment rate has fallen: it probably hasn't.) It's also important to keep in mind that Maricopa County's suburbs aren't just some big chunk of new residential houses and people. Suburb growth is coming to the city of Peoria, the county seat as well (and home to the University of Arizona \u2014 Peoria is Phoenix's satellite, to some extent; Phoenix also has Peoria-Blowing Rock, which is probably as large as the big satellite city, but was omitted due to formatting).\n\nSo Maricopa County is growing (but may not grow as fast as Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale on balance); there are fewer jobs in Mesa (and fewer jobs in", "label": 1, "id": 100595}
{"text": "infections still remain one of the most devastating complications in all types of solid organ transplants. The outcome of infection is not only depending on the severity of the initial manifestation of the disease, but the initial pathogen has a big impact on the outcome of the infection. The development of resistance to conventional antibiotics and the increasing number of multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens have made it hard for the clinicians to cure their patients (R\u00fcst et al., 2011).\n\nDue to the high economic investment and increased demand, there is an increasing number of alternative medicine research performed, as it is cheaper to conduct alternative medicine studies rather than to do a multi-center randomized standard clinical trial. The use of medicinal plants for the treatment of infections is one of the successful alternative medicine treatments. Most of these treatments are derived from conventional medicine because they have long history of use (Salah et al., 2004).\n\nThis special issue of *BMC Infectious Diseases* brings together leading researchers to share recent novel data and the perspectives of current practice and practice standards. In this special edition, three reports discuss the progress between conventional and alternative medicine. In the current review, K.P. Kulkarni and S.K. Bhat summarize antimicrobial activity of herbal medicines and their derivatives in a review article and provide suggestions for future studies. K.B. Patil et al. report the antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial peptides based on food by-products. J.G.S. da Silva et al. present the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants for treatment of tuberculosis. The first review of literature is provided by R.W. Chagas-Filho et al. on the antibacterial activity of natural products such as naphthalenes, phenanthrene, anthracenes, dihydroacridines, amides, and aporphines.\n\nA total of five articles in this special issue focus on the application of traditional medicinal plants for the treatment of infection. These papers demonstrate the pharmacological effects of herbal constituents in a wide range of pathogens. For example, Y.Y. Liu et al. review the anti-infectious property of *Artemisia argyi* Linn. (Compositae) by summarizing the studies on its chemical constituents. *Artemisia argyi* Linn. has a wide array of medicinal properties, including anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticancer and antimicrobial activity (Li, 1992a). M.P.C. Gomes et al. review the antibacterial activity of alcoholic extracts of medicinal plants against *Enterococcus faecalis*. *In vitro* and *in vivo* antibacterial properties of medicinal plants against some micro-organisms associated with root canal infection have been explored by A.Z. Zargar and G.R. Ramezani. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of extracts from leaves of *Nigella sativa* has been explored by H.R. Shamsi and L.F. El-Gebali. J.A.D. da Silva et al. review the application of medicinal plants in the treatment of viral infection and suggest the use of medicinal plants in antiviral therapy.\n\n*BMC Infectious Diseases* is a fully peer-reviewed journal that offers prompt and accurate publication for novel research regarding the traditional use and the clinical research. Original research articles, case reports, review articles, review letters, and short communications in a wide range of topics are being published in BMC Infectious Diseases. Thus, it is a highly competitive, rigorous, and fast journal for the publication of high-quality work. Each paper will be independently reviewed in two rounds. The first round peer review is done by the review team and will consider the clarity of the research question, the rationale for the experimental approach, appropriateness of hypothesis testing, appropriateness of the research method, and relevance of the paper to the special issue. Acceptance of the paper will be determined for publication only if it meets the rigorous journal requirements described above. Authors are highly encouraged to improve their papers for submission and publication.\n\nDue to the rapid advance of technology, this issue is just a snapshot of the state-of-the-art research in the field of traditional medicine. One hundred and sixty researchers from around the globe are collaborating on this special issue. It is hoped that these articles will help stimulate and inspire future research in this important area. We will do our best to improve *BMC Infectious Diseases* in coming years to provide the best platform for you to continue publishing your research work. Finally, we would like to express our sincerest thanks to all the guest editors and reviewers who contributed to this issue.

{"text": "After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that \u2018oh fuck\u2019 feeling that you need before the film goes on. From the beginning the camera is held in an interesting angle and gives you this very distorted view of what is going on. This was a deliberate decision on the director\u2019s part to give this sense of danger to the whole film. I also quite liked that the camera kept going through all the sets and locations. This created this sense of chaos that I suppose you would say \u2018oh fuck\u2019 because you don\u2019t know if you are going to survive the ordeal you are in or not, whereas with regular films you already know what to expect from each location and set.\n\nAfterwards you got your character\u2019s journey, which the film focuses on for around 40 minutes, and I actually found it quite entertaining because it was funny and I actually quite liked where it went. However, I suppose you could say that it was also a bit long because after you had gone through the characters journey, you then got to know what was going to happen but all the clues were hidden because it was all done in flashback moments. However, by the end everything came together and you got quite an interesting outcome. It is a bit like watching somebody you love die and then eventually you survive. I suppose that is the only downfall which is when they finally got to the climax of the film, that moment when you get to find out what happened, however, that was an interesting way to end the film, because it came back to the beginning with one of the characters\u2019 flashbacks and that came together nicely in the end. I did not feel that the ending was too long or too short because the whole film was very interesting and had good dialogue which helped. I actually quite liked that it was not too long which meant that you definitely would want to watch it one more time just to make sure you had not missed anything. My conclusion is definitely that this is a good film, I definitely do recommend this.\n\nThe movie is a lot like a musical. From the beginning the music plays the key chords and you have that weird sensation you get by listening to your favourite songs, like in that scene where you see the character you love on the screen and everything you could think, he was just as cute if not cuter now that this scene has come, just the way you remember him. It is funny, because in the beginning of the film you know who the character is as it starts with his life which I was thinking is a bit strange because we are at the beginning of the film so why is the focus set at his early life. However, I suppose you could say that the director is just looking out for our curiosity to find out the outcome. All the characters\u2019 journeys take us into their past lives. This is a good way to set up each and every character and what they will be like in the near future. All the questions you would want to ask yourself as you watch this, will the character you are looking at end up becoming the one you love? This way is more interesting than just having a normal drama of someone\u2019s life.\n\nFor a lot of people, they might think that this movie is a bit too cheesy and clich\u00e9, because a lot of the dialogue seems like it is straight from the Disney movies but it is not as bad as you would think. As you get to know each and every character he/she will begin to talk more naturally and with the other characters as if they are speaking to you and they are just being them themselves and I really like that, because this is what makes up characters for you, it is the way they talk and the way they express themselves to the other people around them. I really liked that there was not over-acting in the film. Everything played perfectly, like the background score and the way the music was played. For those with the \u2018oh fuck\u2019 feeling, this movie will give you that a bit as well because with the weird camera angles and things like that you get this feeling that this is too normal for the film because you cannot even imagine that it could be this good, let alone how good it is. However, I am a bit disappointed that this did not win the prestigious Oscar because it will definitely deserve it, however, I am looking for this for awards to happen in a couple of years because if they do not award this I will probably be so upset and won\u2019t have the heart to watch anything else for a few years because I will be so mad at Hollywood for not awarding this movie.\n\nAll in all, I definitely love this movie and would recommend that you watch it. I had an enjoyable time watching it on video, so I really hope a cinema is around the corner soon because I think it is a must watch. I know that my love is now immortalised to Disney on this very important day but at the same time I am disappointed that my favourite film this year", "label": 1, "id": 100597}

{"text": "quantum decoherence can arise due to classical fluctuations in the coupling between the two modes. In a regime where the interaction is small but still fluctuates between a low and a high value, the decoherence is much more evident since the low coupling mode enters the interaction dynamics twice (once for the preparation of the excitation and once for the decay of that excitation) and therefore enters in some way into all the dynamical processes of the system. This is the essence of quantum correlation: the effect of quantum noise on the quantum operations is often greater than the effect of quantum fluctuations alone (see discussion of the effect of noise in a qubit system in Ref.[@ref31]), even in the case where the only source of such noise is the quantum fluctuations of the coupling. The quantum correlation is closely related with entanglement, which as we discussed above, is the cornerstone of information processing.\n\nWe note that the model of a single mode interacting with an environment (the single mode bath) at zero temperature which is a fundamental element of such models describing coupling of photons to a single vibrational mode in the ground state of a solid was first investigated theoretically by Duan et al. [@ref32]. They found that if the environment mode was coupled to the mode in a way that the system modes can exchange energy with the mode only when the total energy $E$ of the system+environment is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing $\\hbar \\omega$, then entanglement is present provided that the quantum interference can occur (i.e., both the modes are initially in the $n,n+1$ state). They proposed a model in which the modes interact during the passage of a single photon by passing one mode through the environment, which can be a bath, cavity or oscillator. In Fig.\\[fig1\\] the interaction of a single mode (the bath or cavity mode) with an environment (mode 2 or another bath or cavity, or oscillator in the Duan et al. model) is such that the energy of the interaction system is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing and the excitation transfer is then possible only upon completion of some quantum phase process. With such a model they also showed, interestingly, that the entanglement and the coherence are present and that the quantum interference acts as a witness against the presence of entanglement.\n\n![\\[fig1\\](Color online) Schematic diagram of a single mode interacting with an environment at zero temperature.](fig1.eps){width=\"0.50\\hsize\"}\n\nThis model can be extended to include multiple baths and a general oscillator by introducing a number of modes $m$ in Eq.(1) in a similar way as in the case of the multiple-bath case where the second mode can be coupled to a bath at a rate $\\gamma$ or to a cavity at a rate $\\kappa$. We note that even in the multiple-bath case the energy $E$ of the total system is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing at any time.\n\n![(Color online) Schematic diagram of a system consisting of a single mode plus a mode coupled to an environment.

We again assume that the mode has constant energy independent on the quantum number $z$. Moreover, the case $m\\ne 0$ is taken into account such that the modes can pass through the environment and interact with it. The Hamiltonian for this system is obtained by inserting the mode frequency $\\omega(t)$ in Eq.(1) into $\\hat{H}_{0}$ $$H_{1}=\\hbar \\omega(t)\\sigma_{z}/2$$ where we assume that the environment mode has the same energy $\\hbar \\omega_0$ and $\\hbar \\omega(t)$ is the total energy.

{"text": "According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the film that are actually in danger are not the large-scale polluters. They are the small-scale polluters.\n\nUngar, an environmental and energy consultant based in Austin, Texas, calls himself a \"pessimist\" but maintains his approach makes him very realistic. \"I look at everything as a worst case scenario.\"\n\nWhat does making films \u2014 particularly feature-length ones \u2014 actually do for people who think the world's got it in for them?\n\n\"I feel that it's a part of what we're here for,\" he told Business Insider. \"I personally feel, a little like I said to you that I don't believe the world's against people or even against us, but that it would help out if we don't fight. I feel that the world has chosen us, that's our role to play.\"\n\nThe argument that movies and Hollywood might actually be bringing about a better world has a long history and goes back several decades. There's a belief that with people spending time together in a communal manner, they might come together and start to treat each other with compassion. But it doesn't work like that: There are real-world examples where conflict leads to more conflict, and this tendency continues to create a \"film bubble,\" in which people seem to think that their private problems will be addressed by other people.\n\nA 2016 study by psychologists at the US Army War College found that the mere presence of a movie made people feel less safe, and made them worry their neighbors would leave their homes if they were attacked (a similar study found that the mere presence of reality TV was the most important factor in people becoming less afraid) and that it was the wrong choice to see what others were experiencing.\n\nA 2014 study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found that young adults who spend their free time watching television are more likely to have poorer communication and social skills with their peers. They also have a harder time empathizing with others and having empathy. They are less effective than others at understanding the emotions of others. For that matter, there's a study published in the same year that found people thought someone would be a better parent if he watched a lot of video games.\n\nIt's not just that making a movie or the act of showing a movie can lead to negative consequences. There are also instances of real-world events taking place in the world in the absence of a feature film.\n\nIn 2013, the director of NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover, Andrew Coelho, died on the surface of Mars during a mission he'd spent years leading. Mars Pathfinder, the first rover to walk on the red planet, went even farther to bring back pictures of the entire planet. The mission lasted for over two years and the rover is still working (but no longer roving). Another story is the story of the three boys killed by a gunman in Newtown, CT, that was shown as a movie in 2012, only it wasn't shown as a movie and it didn't have the impact they wanted it to. The movie \"Lincoln\" became an Oscar-winning drama and the best movie of 2012.\n\nIn his book \"The Emperor's New Clothes: The Untold Story of the Battle Between Lies and Truth in the War on Terrorism,\" author Steven Casey says that when people complain about \"America\" it's really about what they have been conditioned to accept: \"The US-patronizing narrative of American supremacy and exceptionalism has been one of what's wrong with culture, in general, all along. If you want to find out about what's real and the truth, you don't have to go to Hollywood.\"\n\nCasey doesn't necessarily go as far as Ungar, but he says that the reality is that the film industry plays the role of protecting people from themselves. \"The industry has convinced people that because they are the dominant economic and cultural paradigm \u2014 you know, that is what we're told, it's not going to be the same every day \u2014 and because, you know, reality TV makes a certain amount of money and reality shows are the only things we're allowed to watch. It's a protection mechanism for the system. People are not going to find out they've been lied to.\"\n\nIn 2013, Ungar made a short film about the dangers of the film industry, \"How to Talk to a Movie Audience.\" The premise was that people were too gullible for their own good and did not believe anything they saw in Hollywood movies. The film was a comedy, but it did not shy away from the reality of Hollywood criticism: \"And I do think there are some films which are out of line. I also know that there are some films the audiences would like a little more realism in.\"\n\nUngar called the film an \"impressively optimistic way for me to address myself the way I see it in Hollywood,\" and while it didn't make a", "label": 1, "id": 100601}
{"text": "measurements of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) temperature provide, respectively.\n\nThe igm is made up of  -sized particles as dark matter of roughly the size of the Milky Way, and an extremely, highly ionized plasma that fills the region between galaxy clusters (the Virgo cluster). In order to understand the origin of the igm, we must first understand how its large and relatively dense components formed.  The formation of the low density components can be understood by considering galaxy mergers. As galaxies merge, most of their baryonic matter is transferred to the more massive component. In most galaxies, the massive galaxy will then collapse into a black hole, and then a second generation of stars form in the newly formed bulge. This bulge and the new stellar material then collapse to become a large elliptical galaxy. The first generation of stars in the bulge will merge again and turn into a second group of low mass stars. The next stage of galaxy evolution is then one of hierarchical buildup, as most low mass galaxies merge to form the most massive galaxies, leading to a large elliptical galaxy such as the Milky Way. The stars forming in the galaxies that are merging together become hot (cool) and dense. While still being in the merger, some of these stars are being heated up by the large scale gravitational potential of the galaxies, in order to remain in a star forming galaxy and become active sources of luminosity (supernovae, gamma ray bursts). The heating of these stars then gradually cools them and makes them more massive and more luminous (and hotter and denser). The stars within these galaxies eventually settle down (turn off) all their internal nuclear stellar activities at a point when the internal temperature becomes close to their observed igm threshold. Once this occurs at a certain point, they become stable objects in the sense, the galactic imeasurements are not much dependent on their internal stellar physics or the galactic environment they were born in. By definition such stable objects have reached a igm threshold of roughly the right temperature and density regime for star formation. The  igm temperature and density has been determined for this galaxy by the star forming activity, and it is  imelike in the sense that the intergalactic medium has reached what is required for the formation of new stars. Other galaxies with ongoing star formation will reach this threshold at different times; but their properties will also continue to be igmlike since they will also have galaxies that started with star formation activity. When our Galaxy is formed out of gas and dust from galaxies merging together, most of the galaxies around us were star forming galaxies.\n\nWhen two stellar galaxies get closer to each other, they continue on merging together as described above, which causes the igm to be made-up of stars that were formed in the earlier massive galaxies. When two large elliptical galaxies merge, they then continue their merger to make a large elliptical galaxy by adding small amounts of stars to the merged galaxies. The galaxy merger then continues as a galaxy cycle of merging and dissolving. Stars that were formed in the earlier elliptical galaxies will merge into the current elliptical galaxy, and the old elliptical galaxies will become old disk galaxies. With the merging of these galaxies over time, they continue to grow and grow over time to become the modern galaxies we observe as our Milky Way.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\nCategory:Star formation\nCategory:Stellar astrophysics", "label": 1, "id": 100602}
{"text": "What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering an all-too-typical slice of life on the French-Canadienne border, turned out to be far more than that, as was apparent from the opening scenes alone. And if one thing is true in this film\u2014a woman's sexual awakening\u2014it is that most men do not actually want what they seem to want; it is far more likely in their nature to desire much more, or much less than the woman's desire.\n\nDirector Claude Chabrol (who was, in fact, the real life father of the actor Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), set his films in the 1950s and '60s. This was an era of repression and taboos against sex, so such stories and the actors who played sex-crazed role models were not unknown in the French cinema, and often very popular in film fan magazines. What Chabrol also set out to do was to present a film that was not about sex, which he would film instead as a series of intimate and sensual conversations with his leading lady, Julie de Toulouse (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Blanchard), and the two young men who were a part of her inner circle of friends, the young artist and poet Fran\u00e7ois (Michel Simon) and the young intellectual Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier (Dany Boon), all three of them in love with each other. It was as if Chabrol, his screenwriter Christian Morin, and their French writer-director, Christian Petzold, had just come together to create a novel that could take a few months of very intense dialogue and very intimate scenes for the storyteller to finish, but in the form of a film that would be far shorter, in a much longer time.\n\n\"How did it start?\" Chabrol asked Pierre (Michel Simon).\n\n\"He had an article published in _Playboy_, and I had a story of my own to write for another magazine, and I asked if he would like to write and do an adaptation of his story? And he did. So that's where the idea came from.\"\n\n\"And you didn't do the adaptation directly from his story?\"\n\n\"No. I wrote the story, and I wrote the screenplay. And then I was offered the job of director. And I thought this was a wonderful opportunity, to create a film out of a story that was very close to me, that I had written and published. I don't know if he was happy about directing, but I was happy with the film we produced.\"\n\n\"And why do you have such strong feelings,\" asked Chabrol, \"about the story and the two characters he made?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Pierre admitted, \"it was so true. I don't know. To be honest, I don't have strong feelings about the characters when you make a movie of people you know.\"\n\n\"But in this case, you did.\"\n\n\"In this case? No, I don't. It's the story, I would like to say that, or that it was the character of Julie who had strong feelings. I don't know really. I can't explain.\" Michel Simon's face was suddenly thoughtful as he nodded to the director, and with a little laugh he added, \"No, it's not true.\" He stared at the director who was still standing there, a little embarrassed, while Pierre sat for a moment as if taking his thoughts into his own hands. Then he looked back at the director, his eyes sparkling, and once more the conversation picked up. \"He liked the characters very much,\" Michel Simon, and Chabrol now understood that this was precisely the case, that he had been unable to resist the temptation to portray the three young people who were very much at the center of his life, and in a way, and who had not the slightest interest in having him as a director. Chabrol was delighted. This was his chance. He could not afford to let this pass.\n\n\"I think you know,\" said Pierre, \"that as a young man I had spent some time in Africa, in the Sahara. I had read many books written by a man who had been there some years ago and had tried to understand how a tribe was organized, how the people treated each other. In particular, I had read about a tribe called the Soninke or Zenga, who are called a warlike, even brutalized people. I would like to know if you think any of them resemble you.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want the film to go as far as it did in your own book,\" Chabrol said with a smile, \"because I believe in giving the audience as much as possible to choose themselves. Not too many people in your book, and not too many people in the movie, right?\"\n\n\"You are such an artist!\" Michel", "label": 1, "id": 100603}
{"text": "First and foremost: I, the author of this piece, don't care whether or not you believe what I have to say. This is not a post about my views on the Israel-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East, although, of course, these may in part shape them. It is about my views on a certain type of discourse about Israel, especially when it involves the language and imagery of Israel, like it or not.\n\nYou see, there's this common tendency among Jews and non-Jews alike: I think that, when it comes to matters of Israel and Palestine, people are far more willing to engage with the subject of the conflict as \"Israel-phobia\" or \"anti-Semitism,\" even if they themselves don't actually subscribe to the view that such a thing is a thing that exists in history and exists today.\n\nThis has always struck me as somewhat ironic, because to suggest that \"anti-Semitism\" is not, itself, an invention of the 19th or 20th centuries -- I mean, isn't that, historically, kind of the norm, or at least that common perception of history? -- seems somewhat strange to me. That's because, honestly, I know that there are people from my generation, who, as I write this, are actually about to be celebrating the sesquicentennial of the Balfour Declaration (the declaration that laid out the principles that led to the creation of the modern nation and Jewish state as two separate countries, or, put another way, two countries -- but never mind!) who, despite the rhetoric of anti-Semitism itself -- the fact that it claims to have been perpetrated by Jews in the 19th Century, despite the fact that it was perpetrated by the British government and not by Jews -- still seem to feel confident that their anti-Semite friends are mistaken about who was really responsible for anti-Semitism, despite the actual historical record supporting that fact. If I'm not mistaken, these individuals have never had the opportunity to read the historical record about the \"anti-Semitism\" that was perpetrated against the Jews in pre-Balfour times, where anti-Semitism was defined as the hatred and prejudice against Jews and Judaism as an exclusive religion, all of it by definition anti-Semitic. (Some anti-Semitism was also perpetrated by the Jews, as I discuss below in this post.) These people can only learn about such histories from actual writings that were actually conducted by historians and not merely from what history books -- and history documentaries -- have told, because without those kinds of records there would be no way to be sure with certainty that such anti-Semitism was indeed committed by Jews and that this phenomenon is, in all probability, an artifact of an already existing discourse about \"Jew-hatred\" and \"Anti-Semitism.\"\n\nNow, it's worth noting that I don't see this as exclusively a European phenomenon. If this were solely a European phenomenon, then I would be more inclined to conclude that Europeans are more prone to engage in anti-Semitic discourse today. However, I would also concede that this is not exclusively a European phenomenon, as is also exemplified by their use of the \"Zionist\" term \"Zionism,\" which is also associated with and used by European Jews. I am not arguing one way or another on that issue.\n\nAnd, to put it bluntly: I am anti-Zionist.\n\nI have always felt that the Zionist movement -- the movement that led to the establishment of the modern state and statehood for Israel in 1948 (among other things) -- is a movement that bears many traits and tendencies that are not exclusive to Israeli citizens. One major reason is because in the words of Israel Hagedorn, the founder of the modern Jewish National Home government of Israel:\n\nThe aim was to create an independent Jewish state and the only possible way to do that was to ensure the existence of a majority-Jewish state in its own lands. The Zionist movement was therefore essentially an attempt of the Jewish people to ensure the creation of their own state. Zionism was therefore the creation of a people with common interests and common origins that would struggle together for their own state. This aim was not an ideology, but the aim was to create a people with an identity.\n\nAt the very least, it makes this movement not just about Israel and Israel as a part of the Jewish people, but also about the Jewish people as a whole. What's more, it also helps to differentiate the Zionist movement from other movements that had similar aims for another country, but which, I would argue, in fact are not similar. In Israel, Zionism is the attempt to create an independent state by ensuring that the majority of the people living in the land of Israel will be Jewish. (And, although not as well-known, the reason that I think the establishment and ongoing presence of the Israeli state are \"part of the Jewish people\" is due to Zionism, specifically to the Zionist people.)

{"text": "Most of the Rhine's current course was not under the direct influence of Roman rule, but it was influenced both by the Romans themselves, and by the tribes to which their soldiers were attached. A legionary commander who lived or fought within the Rhine province or in Germania would have had a particular responsibility for the protection of the river. His role was to maintain the integrity of the frontier, and to prevent the river from drying up (and, if in the hands of the Romans, allowing them to occupy the disputed lands). The legions also had to maintain law and order in their own frontier regions and prevent local tribesmen from encroaching on it. These were often the tribes who, in ancient times, were regarded as the first line of defence against Roman expansion.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Roman army after their defeat in Germania Superior (in 410\u2013411 and under the Emperor Honorius in 476), an independent, local dynasty called the Franks established a strong hold on the Rhine River. However, the Franks had a good reason for being at odds with the Roman authorities in the area they were occupying. First, they were Germans, and by definition, were not Roman citizens. Their king, Charles the Simple, fought in the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the Romans were defeated and forced to seek permission to re-establish their authority over German territory. This was granted under the name of emperor Valens, and was met with open hostility towards Roman authority in the region by the Franks. However, the Romans were not able to prevent the German tribes from rebelling and attempting to regain their independence against the Romans, and for the first time within living memory the Romans had control over most of Germania.\n\nThe early years of the Fifth Punic War (264\u2013241 BC) were the most violent period of all that had ever been recorded in history. Both sides used terror tactics to win their armies round the battlefields. The victory of the Gallic army at the Battle of Tegea in 269 was almost a total victory for the Romans, but the battle had been won with much bloodshed, and eventually the Gauls were driven home from their positions of victory.\n\nThere was also an international aspect to the war which had more to do with the struggle between the powerful Rome and Carthage. The Romans had decided to take on the power of the Greek city of Alexandria, by sending an expeditionary force to defend it. Whilst this was happening, the Greeks launched a war of conquest against the Carthians in Africa, supported in their war by Romans. This resulted in the destruction of Carthage in the Battle of Himera in 241 BC (although it was rebuilt two decades later, both by the Romans and Carthaginians). The war between the Romans and Greeks finished off with the capture of Carthage in 146 BC and the end of the Greek world, with the Romans taking control of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter their victory over the Romans in the fifth Punic War, the Greeks withdrew from the sea areas west of Carthage and founded an empire centred on the Ionian island of Chios (which grew to encompass most of mainland Greece), and the city of Athens was established. The Romans were still able to control their Empire from their naval dominance in the Mediterranean, with the conquest and conversion of Carthage and the end of the Carthaginian Empire in 146 BC. The battle at Cannae was the final great engagement of the war between the Roman and the Carthaginian Empires.\n\nThis was a period of time that saw the downfall of the republic of Athens, which had lasted for around 472 years. The Greek cities of Italy, such as Etruria, Romagna and Latium, were dominated by the Romans, but also controlled by other forces such as the barbarians. This period started in 212 BC, when the Romans occupied Italy and defeated the last of the Greek resistance. After this, the Romans conquered and absorbed the tribes of the northern Italian peninsula for around 70 years, culminating in Emperor Augustus' conquest of Rome in 29 BC (in the year 30 BC) and the establishment of the Roman Empire.\n\nDuring this time a Roman Empire had been established and the Roman language was still used in a significant way. This allowed Romans to make important contributions to science and literature, which would have otherwise not be possible. For example, Cicero was the first known Roman to write and record the philosophy of Epicurus. However, there was a problem because of the use of the Latin language, with the inability of Roman soldiers to speak Greek. They therefore had to live using an approximation of Greek which was known as Latin. For example, Julius Caesar ordered his soldiers to use the Latin form of address in frontend to their commander and Caesar's soldiers. Other Latin words, such as those used to describe money (aditus) or to describe the military (expeditus) remained in the words in use by the Romans themselves until the 16th century.\n\nFor a number of years", "label": 1, "id": 100605}
{"text": "In the Philippines, the private sector has been a major engine of economic growth. This has been apparent for some time as the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines expanded at an average rate of 4.4 percent from 1993 until the end of 2002. At that time, the total economy of the Philippines was projected to rise to 2.7 trillion pesos. The following table provides a summary of that growth.\n\nThe size of the economy at various dates\n\n1/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2002\n\n2/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2003\n\n3/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2004\n\n4/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2005\n\n5/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2006\n\n6/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2007\n\n7/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2008\n\n8/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2009\n\n9/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2010\n\nFrom these data, one can observe that the Philippines economy grew slowly from 2003 until 2008. This was due to the relatively low GDP growth rate for 2003. This slow growth was due to the fact that the country experienced economic shocks from 2004 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2009 through the aftermath of the crisis in the Middle East.\n\nIt is important to note that between 2001 and 2005, the Philippines experienced an economic shock with the collapse of the Philippine peso. This contraction had a huge economic impact since the collapse of the peso was the first to reach the level of the equivalent of 9% GDP growth. After the devaluation of the peso led to an economic shock in October 2005, GDP grew between 2004 and 2006. This showed that the economy is resilient to shocks.\n\nEconomic shocks\n\nThe first shock came in the form of the collapse of the Philippine Peso in 2003. The economy of the Philippines experienced a GDP decline of 3.2% of GDP. During this phase, the economy was hit by a number of cyclical factors.\n\nOne of the major events that led to this crisis was the slowdown of a number of countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and South Africa. Inflation in the Philippines was also at an extremely high rate during this period reaching 10.4 percent by year 2009. These economic shocks came out of nowhere. They are not related to the crisis in the Middle East.\n\nFigure 5 shows the Philippine economic data for 1997-2005. The following table shows the cumulative impact of the country's economic shocks on GDP. This would show the extent of the impact on real GDP from the economy of the Philippines.\n\nFigure 5\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nThe above graph indicates that the effect of the above-mentioned economic shocks has been cumulative. This has been evident for the following reasons. During the period of 1997 to 2004, the Philippines experienced an economic shock with low GDP growth rate. After the economic shock of 1998, the Philippines economy experienced lower growth until 2004. After the 2007 economic shock, the Philippines experienced a surge in growth after reaching a high point in 2007. The graph shows how economic shocks have been able to recover after the economic shocks and are still capable of recovering even when the economic shocks have not ceased.\n\nAfter the economic shocks, the growth rate grew in 2006 and 2007. This was due to the good weather in 2006.\n\nOne of the major measures used by the Philippine government to stimulate the economy is the stimulus program. This is one of the areas for future research. Since most of the economy of the country is agricultural, future development should focus on this type of industry.\n\nThe government should take into account that economic shocks affect not only the government but the private sector as well. This is due to the fact that people would often take measures to deal with economic shocks. This is due to the fact that people take measures based on their own beliefs and assumptions.\n\nIn response to many challenges, the Philippines economy is resilient and has become a major market to export many goods. For example, on average, every year 4.3 goods exported by the Philippines are to countries in the Middle East. This is in spite of the fact that during the above mentioned period, the Philippines economy experienced many economic shocks.\n\nIn spite of the above, other challenges were experienced during the 1990s. One of them was about the role of the government in the economy. The government was still considered a major contributor into the economy.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government reduced the role of the private sector in the economy. Before the economic crisis of debt, the private sector had been the main contributor to economic growth. A number of policies were introduced by the government that sought to limit the role of the private sector in the economy.\n\nIn summary above, the challenges experienced during the 1990s showed that the government's role was still a major contributor to", "label": 1, "id": 100606}

The problem is it only takes up the 15\u2033 screen of the i7 Pro 15.4\" laptop but it weighs over a pound too and not enough space.\n\nSo would I want a 15\u201d iPad which weighs under a pound or should I get a 12\u201d 4K iPad?\n\nThe answer is obvious, it depends.\n\nA 12\u201d iPad might be a better tablet. But at the moment that is only a guess I\u2019m hoping for the right reason to move to using a tablet at work.\n\nRight now I was on a budget and I wanted a smaller tablet to carry all day. If the iPad Pro with Retina display becomes available will I just wait for it?\n\nAlso, what will the power of that screen be if it were to not offer the Retina display?\n\nAlso, what will battery life be like?\n\nLastly is the iPad tablet a viable option for travel or daily use?\n\nIt is probably not worth buying a new iPad until that new 12\u201d 4K iPad becomes available as it still might not be viable for daily or many months use.\n\nI\u2019m using the iPad Pro in my work setup at the moment but I have not yet bought any new electronics.\n\nI want to get the new i7 4th Gen iPad Pro as I only use it 2 days a week. Also it would be nice to have the iPad Pro and the keyboard dock. Will those two things combine easily or will my setup to have to replace the keyboard dock every few weeks until it can run at full speed?\n\nI use it twice a week at most. But I\u2019m not sure if those two components and the iPad Pro combined makes it worth it for me as I\u2019m on a budget.\n\nI haven\u2019t read all the threads. but I have to agree with one thing. the iPhone will get into a race. the iPhone isn\u2019t going to win the race, unless you are a very large corporation that can afford a very large number of workers.\n\nMy only concern is with the smaller iPhone. In some ways it is better than the iPad; one of the obvious improvements is the larger screen.\n\nHowever, all of the recent small tablets now out compete the iPhone. There are probably around 2 dozen in a large category. They are quite expensive though, and if Apple is trying to keep costs down the last to enter will probably be the cheapest.\n\nSo when will it be time to switch to Apple products as opposed to the Android products?\n\nI would have assumed you would have written that article for PC Mag instead of this blog, especially without links to your own work.\n\nI think Apple\u2019s focus this year was going to be on iWoz, and that was the reason why they have cut off from PC Mag. I think when the iPhone is released it will be an iPhone 8 or a better yet iPhone X, and Apple would focus to get as good a piece of hardware out on launch day as they can get.\n\nThen will it be the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or an iPhone 8s with bigger screen and then a iPhone X? I would like to have an iPhone X but I don\u2019t want to carry around something that large. That is why the i9 4K is the best option for me.\n\nYou know that at this point I\u2019m a fan of the small tablet. But when the iPhone X comes out in a few months, then you\u2019ll see all the big companies fighting over who will have the most and biggest iPhone in a single device.\n\nI got a look at your article on the iPad Pro. If they continue with iPad Pro, with the 4K screen, then the iPad Pro would get pretty hard-core competition from the iPad Pro with Retina display. And the latter could eat away at the small iPad Pro in all aspects.\n\nI don\u2019t think we are at the point of the screen size war in smartphones, as we are having with tablets. There are currently 3 different sizes, at least 2 of which are 4K screens. The one thing that I don\u2019t like about the \u201cS\u201d size tablet is the lack of ports. I always wanted a keyboard dock, but with it", "label": 1, "id": 100607}
{"text": "This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. So bad that even a person like me (who was on the fence about it) and who is not normally a \"jerk\" still gives it 1.5 star rating out of ten.\n\nI thought the plot was going to be \"bad\" because the actors where trying to kill themselves off as much as possible, but when we find out the actual plot of the movie, I could say that it was one of the few movies that ever had a good and bad part. The bad came in when the movie tried to be too perfect, and the \"good\" part came when the movie turned out too realistic (which was a relief for me and a lot of other die hard horror fans). The movie had lots of special effects and was really different from what we are used to see nowadays, it felt like an actual, real horror movie. I mean, the whole movie did not have blood, it didn't have a dead body at the end. There was only one blood splat, and then the movie ended. Although, when I say the horror was realistic, I mean the movie was really realistic in how it was acting. The acting was absolutely terrible, and when the actors tried to make it realistic, it was the opposite of the movie's good part. I thought it would be funny to imagine a scene where the characters died because of \"real\" horror of it, which it was a horror movie about. I have never seen a more horrifying movie on TV or on the big screen. I thought it was one of the worst movies I did see. At least it's on Netflix now.\n\nNo one dies because of the evil of the characters or the storyline, the characters died because of real horrors. The movie is about one group of three college people (that was the characters) that suddenly got scared of a haunted house, and they came together to clean it and it didn't turn out the way they expected. The acting made me cringe, too much \"action\" shots.\n\nI loved the movie and it is now on Netflix but I'm still madly hoping that there was a TV version like the last movie that I saw - Evil Dead remake - that I could have seen.\n\nAs a great movie based on three young people trying to do the same thing in an eerie house, it was disappointing. I really wanted to know why everything turned out ok for the four characters despite the fact that it should have made them all dead. I wanted to see what happened to them. I hope there is a sequel. I only saw it online last night.\n\nI gave the film 3 stars because overall I found it very suspenseful and I really liked the look of it with the blood and gore but the ending to it was horrible; the ending for me killed the whole atmosphere of the movie in the blink of an eye (it really did)\n\nthis is a really, really scary movie. i actually was scared when i watched this movie (it's not one of the scariest movies i've watched, it's not like The Strangers in the beginning but i have seen that movie and was scared, so i'm glad it made an impression on me lol )\n\nnot a gore site and not a scary site, but this movie does scare the shit out of you. i actually thought about leaving after about a minute because it had a bad end i just couldn't make it through the movie without having my heart beating like crazy, crying a lot, and in short i just couldn't sit there for too long. i also thought about leaving after watching this as well but i had to force myself to stick it out. i actually am surprised this movie made me feel scared because i thought it would be very different from any movie i've seen so far but even though it was different i did have the same reaction when i watched it. maybe its because it's not super scary or too easy to fall asleep to or maybe its because i'm an adrenaline junkie like everyone elses and i'm used to watching things that scares me... but this movie is the bomb from top to bottom. a scary movie, a thriller like movie, and an intense horror movie at the same time. the movie actually has some good acting, like the cast, and they had some chemistry together, which is unusual, some were the same from one scene to the other, some didn't change their performance at all from scene to scene, and some were just one scene from scene. the movie was well paced, and had some really interesting ideas, especially the plot, a haunted house movie i would call it. it really had a completely different idea then anything else i've ever seen and it really felt good to watch. it was actually really sad to me but it also had a really great message, which is what i found scary about it. it has a similar message to horror and horror movies because it's about being scared and not being able to help", "label": 1, "id": 100608}

After a proper transformation to the atomic orbital basis representation for the target (the nucleons), the matrix elements can be written in a form which can be readily used for the calculation of reaction cross sections following the Glauber approximation.\n\nWe consider only the scattering of a single projectilelike electron by a single target like nucleus without any background to which the electron can be scattered (for the scattering by the vacuum electrons of light nuclei we refer the reader to Refs. [@Griko64; @Glauber2]). The elastic scattering at $T=300$ keV is already a reasonably well-known cross section, while the experimental error ranges from a few percent to one or two in cases when the projectile particle (electron in this case) is a nucleus (electrons in this case are electrons). When we want to calculate the cross section for the scattering of an electron with the nucleus the effect of the background potential must be included. The simplest way to do this is to take into account the contribution of the virtual states to the electron scattering amplitude in the form of the scattering states $|M\\rangle,|N\\rangle,...$. Note that since in our situation scattering by an electron is essentially elastic there is no contribution from the excited state $|N,{T_T\\!\\! =\\!\\! T \\! - \\! E_C\\!\\! =\\!\\! 300 \\mathrm{\\ }} \\rangle$ (or $|T\\rangle$ which is the ground state of the target atom) to the total cross section. Since it is known that excited state corrections in the elastic electron scattering to the total cross section are small (less than a few percent), we take for the elastic scattering cross section $\\sigma_0(T)= \\langle N,0|V_{el}|N;T;0\\rangle $ [@Zhukov] as the zero energy value of the elastic scattering cross section, which can be well approximated by an effective local potential at the distance of a $^{56}Fe$ nucleus located at the origin $r_0$ from the electron. The form of this potential $\\hat{V}_{el}$ used for the $^{56}Mn$ and $^{208}Pb$ cases is shown in Fig. \\[fig:potential\\]. We take into consideration that both targets $^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb have charge numbers between $N=58$ and $N=114$ (and therefore their nuclear charge distribution is symmetrical) with the volume V=$R^3$. For the calculation presented in this paper the volume $V=R^3$ of an atom in its ground state $|\\mathrm{A,vac,T=0 \\rangle}$ and its radius R=$\\langle N,0|r|N,0 \\rangle^\\frac{3}{2} $ have been used. The potential used for the other nuclei is symmetrical.

The ccd observations of a 20 deg$^{2}$ region of the Galactic center in the observation band of 0.2 - 10keV (about 30ks) were performed for two consecutive orbits with the EPIC camera in small window mode (1/4 CCD) and one of the nine cameras with a large window mode (3/4 CCD), as shown in Figure 1, where a source named 1 corresponds to the CXB position (Figure 17).\n\n![Observation of the Galactic center region in *XMM-Newton* field by \u201cXSCD\u201d mode [@xmcd_data] []{data-label=\"fig:image_ob\"}](figures/fig3.eps)\n\n![A schematic view of the observations of the Galactic center region by the ccd imaging.

A more detailed description of the reduction procedures for all data used in this work is given in a previous paper [@xmath0_paper]. We followed the standard analysis to produce an image in the 0.2 - 10 keV band for our sources, and a light curve with a binning of 1000 s in each observation. Figure 3 shows all the obtained light curves. The errors due to Poisson statistics were estimated to be on the order of 0.04$\\%$ in the 0.2 - 10keV band, so we can safely consider a detection is a statistically meaningful [@xmcd_data].\n\nAs a result, a number of faint X-ray sources were observed in the Galactic center region in the 0.2-10keV band and the ccd photometric results were compared with those obtained in the ccd imaging mode, which were presented in previous papers [@xmath0_1; @xmath0_2; @xmath0_3]. In those previous papers, the sources were assumed to be point sources without any correction, so the resulting photometry (hereafter referred to as 0.2-10keV) was less accurate than those by the ccd imaging (hereafter referred to as 0.2-10keV).\n\nOur result of one such faint source is listed in Table 4 together with its ccd photometry result from the ccd imaging, which is denoted as CCDIMAGE. The difference between the ccd photometry and that from the ccd imaging is discussed in several previous papers. [@xmath0_1] and [@xmath0_2] claimed the photometry by the ccd imaging is about 0.2-0.5 and 0.2-0.8 times more accurate, respectively, which was partly based on the large error caused by the pile-up effect. [@xmath0_3] argued that because the pile-up effect is not observed in the ccd imaging, ccd photometry should be used instead of ccd imaging in order to avoid possible overestimation.\n\n[c c c]{} X-ray & &\\\n& CCD & ccd\\\n\n& & 1-sigma\\\n\n\\\n& & 1-sigma\\\n\n\\\n& &\\\n\n& &\\\n& &\\\n\n\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n[lrrr]{}\n\n$f_{1,20000(1/2)}$0.03 (8.0) $\\pm$ $0.13$ & 3.0 & $0.1-2.0$ & $0.8$\\\n$f_{1,12000(1/2)}$0.05 (6.8) $\\pm$ $0.18$ & 1.0 & $0.2-2.0$ & $0.5$\\\n$f_{1,9000(1/2)}$0.04 (5.8)", "label": 1, "id": 100610}

It didn't have a good script.\nI watched it in a two hour span and by the time\nit was over and I was done watching it, it really just\nfelt like the writers just said, \"I don't care anymore\nand I'm just gonna make this whole movie suck.\"\nI mean, in theory, it was a bad movie, but I'm glad I\ndid.

{"text": "any spacetime containing a degenerate killing horizon, such as a black hole, it is believed that this \u2018topological\u2019 nature persists at late times, but it is a matter of debate whether it survives to the formation of the singularity itself. For a more recent review of this subject see [@s1]. A review covering the topic from the viewpoint of general relativity and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes can be found in [@s2] whereas [@s3] gives a somewhat different viewpoint from the asymptotically flat background.\n\nThere are many reasons to conjecture that the apparent degeneracy of Killing horizons might be replaced by a discrete set of solutions characterized by the nature of their degenerate Killing horizons and their spacelike degeneracies; in particular by a discrete set of the first homotopy group for which $\\Pi_1(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx \\{ 1,h,h^2 \\}$ [@st2]. This conjecture and the related conjecture regarding different topological interpretations for degenerate Killing horizons have sparked a lot of discussion in the physics literature. The basic idea is that if one considers the spacetime as a 3-manifold it will have a topological structure that can always be decomposed uniquely into 3 distincts connected components, one topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere, and the other two topologically equivalent to balls which are topologically equivalent to 2-tori. This argument has been used in the context of gravitational topology in different contexts and has proved to be a fruitful starting point for such conjectures in (e.g.) Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory and string theory[@w2]. However in the context of vacuum Einsteinian gravity with positive cosmological constant it is questionable to assume that the spacetime can be uniquely decomposed into topologically distinct subregions and there is no obvious argument to prove or disprove any conjecture such as given above. In the context of the vacuum Einstein theory it has been argued, that the Killing vectors of the degenerate solutions might have a similar topological character to those of their static counterparts [@kimball], a characterization that is independent of the particular choice of vacuum solution. A similar analysis has been performed in [@barrow], where it was argued that the Killing vectors of the degenerate Killing horizons might not have a topological origin, but might correspond to what is known as the \u2018topological\u2019 symmetries of the spacetime, an argument that is not valid in general, however, for vacuum solutions. It might be noted here, that the issue of topological degeneracy of Killing horizons and their continuous character seems to have no impact whatsoever on the possibility of existence of black hole solutions with a non-constant curvature[@abh] and for this reason the continuous degeneracy has mostly been ignored in the literature devoted to such issues.\n\nA detailed understanding of the role played by the continuous degeneracy (or otherwise) of the Killing horizons in the context of spacetime singularities would not only be very helpful in understanding the role played by continuous degeneracy in the early universe as well as in the context of the black hole remnant formation but it would also have very interesting consequences in cosmology as well as in any other theoretical description of the late time universe that attempts to explain the present behavior of the universe on a more general basis, i.e. considering all solutions with non-constant curvature. The existence and uniqueness of the horizon-crossing time in the context of black hole evaporation has also been a source of important questions in the literature. These issues have been studied extensively for the Schwarzschild black hole and they have been addressed both via the use of analytical solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations on a de Sitter or anti-de Sitter background [@b1; @b1; @b2] and numerically in a large variety of spacetimes [@a1; @a2; @a3; @b3]. In a recent work [@b4] the possibility of avoiding horizon or event horizons was considered by considering spacetimes with topologically trivial boundary. While it is easy to show that such a solution does not exist, the authors in [@l] were the first to attempt to show the uniqueness of the black hole horizon. Since our spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter this solution seems to be a natural extension of the one presented in [@b4]. We would like to point out that the present paper does not deal with the uniqueness of black hole horizon. The issues regarding boundary conditions at the singularity have already been discussed extensively in [@b5] and these issues have not been considered here. We will not dwell into the issues regarding the uniqueness of the horizon for our spacetime. As is well known, uniqueness of the black hole horizon is", "label": 1, "id": 100614}

It is an array.\n\nTo output a specific CSS file you need to include it by reference in it.\n\n2.6 You can get the list of all css libraries and their names in $cssLibsArray. You can also pass it as \"--css-libs\" parameter to \"sass compiler\" or you can build it by yourself as a bash script (see bash scripts in docs).\n\n2.7 It is possible to export the list of stylesheets and/or the list of libraries in the file \"vendor/jquery/jquery.js\". You can also read about it in the file \"vendor/bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less\".\n\nYou can find an example of this in the file \"custom.less\".\n\n2.8 To make this folder use Sass you need to include it in your page. Do it in the main.css file. As an example, the following code toggles the style with jQuerys library:\n\n.section__header {.section.container { position: inherit; color: inherit; @include responsive($breakpoint, 576); } }\n\n2.9 It is also possible to use some of the libraries available from this git repo like SASS (SASS is an awesome library for defining variables and their values), LESS and BEM.\n\nIn 3.0 we are going to add a function which will help you to manage all your custom variables in one simple way. You will be able to define variables, get their values, change their value and also define new variables as soon as you need it! And then change its value if the need it!\n\nTo keep it short in this post, we are going to add a simple function which will help you to manage all your custom variables in one place. You will be able to get, change and define custom variables in any of your sass code and in any css file!\n\nThe main.css file should include 3.0.0. The vscss file defines all of your custom variables in it. The less/bootstrap/less can get its value thanks to 3.0.0.\n\n3.0.0: This is the version of Sass and Less with which you (if you use \"sass language server\" and write sass_compiler.rb to compile a stylesheets) will be able to use custom variables.\n\nThe custom variables are named in the following way:\n\n%customVariable-name%\n\nThey will be defined in the following way:\n\n%customVariable-name%\n\nIn the file \"vendor/bootstrap/less/custom.less\" use the sass compiler to get them all.\n\nThe files \"vendor/bootstrap/less/custom.less\" and \"vendor/jquery/jquery.js\" are generated thanks to this procedure, we should get the following output from a page with a variable named \"customVar\" in it:\n\n@customVarColor-color: #FFF\n\nUsing this value we can change it on our page:\n\n@customVarColor-color: red\n\nTo get the list of all the custom variables we can use \"custom.less\" file's sass compiler and then pass it as an argument.\n\nThen to define a new one we can simply add \"custom.less\" code inside its comment. You can change or create all of them!\n\n3.0.0 also has a function which will help you to manage all your custom variables in one, common and easy place (and you", "label": 1, "id": 100615}

The variable $l\n= 1,-1$ represents the spin state in $z$ or $x$ axis.

{"text": "Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where you start, scratch your head, then wonder what the Hell did all of the fuss and all of the marketing BS add up to? It's a good little movie, in its own way, an odd little movie with a lot of great ideas for other films, but ultimately, I've lost interest in it. Like The Thing from Another World.\n\nThe Thing, from the book by a guy named Stuart Gordon:\n\nI was only the third producer and it was my first film, but I'm gonna say 'Thing' because that's what it was, the Thing, in The Thing from Another World. I was very pleased with the script. It had some great ideas in it. And I decided to take another run at it with my next film. I had originally titled It Came from Outer Space, so I took it to United Artists. They loved it, which was great because they needed to make one to test the waters. And even at that time, I thought they should do it as a thriller. You wouldn't be able to put the idea about a meteor landinin on Earth in a horror, thriller kinda movie. They made the call for 'a sci-flick.'\n\nAnd then, I did It Came from Outer Space and it was okay. I made my second picture, and I thought I was sorta in a'sophomore slump' at United Artists. And for some reason, they picked This Island Earth, in which I made a deal with the studio to do one thing and one thing only. I put the idea of a man being sucked into a wormhole in, and in came The Thing. I thought to myself, 'This one is going to be a success, for the same reasons as It Came from Outer Space.' In fact, I still believe that to this day. But instead of a man being sucked into a wormhole, this movie had the wormhole being sucked towards the Earth, so it was almost a science fiction version of a horror feature. I thought that would be a nice way to finish the job, and I thought the'sophomore slump' would be over. And the end result would be a sci-fi horror feature that nobody would talk about. But it turned out to be the death trap that it was. It was 'The Thing' that nobody talked about.\n\nYou'll notice my first two movies are all, apparently, all part of an experiment where the studios were buying up all of the ideas and then letting me do them under their names. But that experiment was an epic failure that continues in all of my subsequent films from then on. It wasn't until my third movie, which was done from scratch, that any success actually came back to me thanks to a deal with United Artists, and The Thing was the first film under my name. But it was a failure that started me down a career of being the only man involved in all of those films.\n\nAnyway, back to This Island Earth, which in reality I was only in on a deal for another $1,000,000, since I'd had to rewrite, and because the script was so bad, you had to wonder what else wasn't written by the guy. It's called An Island Earth, and it's a travelogue around a foreign world, sort of like Planet of the Apes, with one difference; they had already shot most of the action. It began with Jack Benny playing the head of the studio, and in that, it seems like the only person around him is a couple of German scientists. Anyway, Benny starts off by describing the new kind of sci-fi picture they're about to launch, and I think he's referring to the movie that has a scientist being sucked into a wormhole.\n\nBut they're not sure how to do it. And suddenly, the head of the studio walks in, looks at the movie set up, and says, 'What the hell are they gonna shoot us in here?' And then, the idea came up that he had the head of a meteor, and could he have the head of a wormhole? And then he went into further detail, how could he have the head of a wormhole, but have his own head in the shape of a meteor, so he wouldn't have to wear any helmets while performing all of his actions? Then, I thought of the way the meteor was about to strike the planet.\n\n'I'm no engineer,' he said. 'But, I'm sure I can build a suit that would fit him perfectly.'\n\nOne of the German scientists, a Mr Wachter, says, 'Well, if we can just give him a suit that looks like a human being wearing a human head.'\n\nSo he goes and gets the human head off a scientist, a man named Schick, whom he thought was dead, but then wasn't.

{"text": "This film took me by surprise. I make it a rule never to look at a man\u2019s chest, but at about the halfway point the film got to the place where we were supposed to see him chest, and we did. I looked down then immediately began to worry because the script called for either his eyes, or chest with or without makeup, all depending on the scene, and he never did seem to get to a shot without someone looking down on his chest. In a moment of complete panic I looked him in the eye and he was staring down at my chest.\n\nThere really are no rules when it comes to art and film. So the next day, when the crew got here and I got on set I looked for him a few moments and made sure he was ok. I thought maybe this was just an elaborate ploy by the script, or perhaps the director felt that it would only endear him to the viewer. So, the next day I decided to check him for myself by going up to him, to see if he were ok or not, and was met with nothing other then someone staring down, so I gave up. We took a walk around and I decided to go back to work.\n\nThe film was amazing and for a time it seemed that this was what the American film scene should be. Every single shot was just so so. Like, I have never in my life seen an actor with a gun pointed at him, and as a person that has experienced a range of violence from a family member to a stranger I was blown away. In the final analysis, the film did not stand on this amazing score and did not take the amazing scenes of shooting and editing. But the scene of shooting himself, which was also done on screen, was great. I will not spoil it because it is one of my favorites in the film (along with the scene just before it in which the actors play themselves acting out the script), but let us just say it was an incredibly great scene. He is just dead set in a dead set shot of his chest. You can hear the audience gasping throughout the course of the shot. It is not easy to make the audience gasp. His shirt is pulled down by a belt, and the gun is pressed to his left nipple. It is just the most powerful thing to look at. The actor playing himself, Mark Salling is just simply superb. It is a great scene for him to make.\n\nI will say that the film had a lot of problems. Firstly, let me explain how you can think of every flaw in a narrative film. The first problem is that the storyline is not strong enough. By the time it reached the story telling point it was already at the end point and we were given a recap. Which I will tell you is not the same as the introduction to every plot you would see, and that is what they had to do.\n\nThe recap was very weak and so much information just got left out. For instance, there are moments of great dialogue and great music in the film, but they are not shown, and we go from this point to the end in an hour. It should have taken us about a half hour. To show more people what had happened. I wish I had a transcript for you guys, because I had to take many trips to the bathroom during that half hour alone, to vomit and go to my room with the windows open because I would just throw up on the bed. It was terrible. I will say that once we left the first time in the theater I told myself that yes, we should make it on home video, but I did not and then I watched it at home and thought: Why do I think we have to show the film in its entirety in this version?\n\nAnd there is another flaw. In essence it tells a story of a lot of women who are being hunted after taking a small amount of a drug that is being used as a sleeping aid. It was a cheap drug until the early 90s. There was no such thing as a female version of the drug, but that does not deter the film from telling a women\u2019s story. But there was no explanation for why this woman is trying to find people that have done this drug, until we get to this part of the film. In essence, the film is just this woman telling this woman how the drugs is being used to sleep, and then the story continues right after. This was not explained at all.\n\nThe film is very fast. It is shot on film, in 8\u2019 2\u2019 3\u2019. And for some reason, I don\u2019t even know what this can have to do with whether it is good or not, but I feel compelled to say it. The film is shot in such a way as to have a very fast shutter speed. We are so used to actors having a look of the film in the editing room which would be slowed to 1.5", "label": 1, "id": 100619}

The staff won't be here',\u201d said Tyldesley, who has severe diabetes and was bed-bound.\n\nHe eventually became the hospital's only person able to use a toilet \u2013 at which point he was removed from the wheelchair by a \u201cfriend\u201d dressed in full NHS uniform.\n\nThe hospital's former manager Michael Green says that while it is not true to say staff were only present in the area to provide basic care \u2013 on his part he is confident that the only patients cared for by the hospital at the time he was in the room would have been in the \u201cvery advanced stages of dementia, multiple sclerosis and other disabling conditions\u201d.\n\nAccording to the hospital's patient records there were 24 visits to the room \u2013 for different patients \u2013 during that week, totalling just under 18 hours.\n\nWhen the hospital's director of care, Michael Leishman, was asked in his evidence to the Royal Commission on Medical and Health Care Learning whether he had accepted that medical carers on staff at time are often working up to 100 hours a week \u2013 rather than just the hours officially listed \u2013 he said this was the best he could do.\n\n\u201cThe truth is this: I was told at the time that we are working very intensively \u2013 a lot of weekends,\u201d Leishman told the inquiry \u2013 but added he \"couldn't tell you how many hours you have out of each day\".\n\nHe said hospital management was also being supported by his management team when they were \u201clooking for solutions that may help\u201d.\n\nUnder cross-examination by barrister John McVeigh, chief lawyer of the Commission, Leishman agreed that staff were on duty during regular and irregular hours, but said: \u201cIt could have been a very few times a week, it could have been a very few hours a week, but I can't answer for that.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry was told that, although he had agreed this, Leishman did not know how much other staff were working overtime.\n\nWhile the inquiry was not told the exact number of staff working at night or weekends, on the morning before he had left the room, his management team discussed having a full-time duty doctor at the Royal Infirmary \u2013 to provide continuity in care, by giving emergency care as and when required.\n\nLeishman said they had considered adding staff on an ad hoc basis, but had realised doing this at the Royal Infirmary would risk the hospital not having sufficient doctors.\n\nThe inquiry also heard that Leishman said at the time: \"I could not possibly say how many doctors we have. We have a medical staff of 25, 25 part- time doctors, and 20 doctors in the Royal College of General Practitioners, and we do not have enough doctors or nurses.\"\n\n\n\nA doctor is seen in a medical scrubs and cap during a media tour of the Royal Hospital of which the director of care was awarded the MBE in the 2015 New Year Honours List.\n\nIn the opening statement of his evidence Leishman said staff were on duty at night, and staff were involved in out-of-hours care when the hospital was under a code of conduct for staff under the Mental Health Act 1984.\n\nWhen asked whether he understood there was no official policy on the number of people working nights or weekends, it was his recollection \u201cthat was probably what had been agreed up-stairs\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe inquiry continues at 8.30am on Wednesday October 11.", "label": 1, "id": 100620}

{"text": "A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between the actors, suggesting that they were from an earlier generation. They were never really given a chance in the show as we know it; many of them were simply too old or too \u201cunworthy\u201d to get a spot.\n\nBut I personally don\u2019t know anything about the producers, writers, directors, etc. who made up the program they wanted or wanted to create: I was too young to have watched the program to be truly aware of the people behind the set. The reality shows of the day, reality films, or other \u201creality\u201d based-programs of the day was all created by the producers/writers/directors based on their personal vision, and the people on the set did not have a say in who, what, why they were chosen to appear on the show.\n\nBut based on the fact the casting call was \u201cnot quite right\u201d as far as the actors concerned, I believe all the programs we have in television today, are actually the best version the producers/writers/directors wanted of them.\n\nSo, based on my theory of the case as shown by this comment from a previous post, I believe that any show that has the cast on it, is almost always trying to be something the audience and producers actually wanted it from the beginning but didn\u2019t know or could not control for one reason or another.\n\nSome would consider this theory as stupid, but I would rather suggest it as a possible possibility. So, as to whether or not the casting on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d was right or wrong, I\u2019d say it definitely wasn\u2019t! But, based on the fact that the producers/writers/directors knew who they wanted from the show to be on the show because they had talked to the cast previously, it makes a lot more sense in my mind.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI guess the show is a step up from any other reality show with contestants, as all the people they auditioned were the people they\u2019d want on the show.\n\nAnd I think as a viewer, I don\u2019t blame the participants for being on the show, if you know that you\u2019re not going to be chosen for the show because you won\u2019t be a \u201cgood enough\u201d singer, and then you have to go out and audition for the show\u2026to put themselves out for another chance of becoming one of the many \u201cunworthy\u201d people to perform during the audition round. They needed to do it to become on the show, so they did it, and now that they\u2019ve done it, they can relax on why they came and performed, and really focus on the task they chose to take on, whether it be musical or just singing, the task was not to audition for the show..that\u2019s why they were brought on the show in the first place.\n\nBut it really sucks when you know in your heart that the casting call for the show was not right, but you still get chosen for it because of the chance you had or the casting directors wanted you on the show. That\u2019s a huge waste. In addition to the wasted talent in the casting call\u2026which in my opinion, they should have had no choice but to cast the audition round, as I am sure even the most qualified participant would be unable to put up a better show than he performed with.\n\nIn my eyes, there was just not enough time during the audition rounds of the show so the producers/writers/directors could get to know each auditionee and give the cast every chance, but then had to stop it because they figured out who auditionee was going to be eliminated. That was really sad. But, at the very least, a different outcome would have been if they had done the audition rounds the right way.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve seen the show, and that I\u2019ve talked with the producers/writers/directors about it, I totally get why they had the wrong casting call for the show. The show really made a difference for only about 5 people auditioned and chose to move on to the live round. The others, they had already chosen their final fate in their minds before the show because the casting call was \u201cnot quite right.\u201d\n\nBut it really, really sucks when you know in your heart that the casting call was right for you, but they still chose you no matter what. I mean, at the very beginning of the show, all 5 of the participants thought they were really going to be on the show because they believed they were the best singers and the other contestants would know that, too. Unfortunately due to someone, some one(s) got fooled in the casting call and they all went on the show no matter what at first. And then you look at the show", "label": 1, "id": 100622}

If Mars had a thick atmosphere (in some cases the thickest in our Solar System\u2019s history), it would have been a world rich in water. But it would have been dry, probably because of the strong greenhouse effect it experiences. Now the Earth is suffering from climate change, which may or may not be a result of greenhouse warming. We may suffer the consequences soon.\n\nBut climate change did not happen only on Earth\u2014it happened also to Venus, at least in their last few years, according to the study of Mars and Venus published in the journal Science. Venus does not have a thick atmosphere and doesn\u2019t show the \u201cgreenhouse warming\u201d that Mars does. But it does have an extremely dense atmosphere. Could that atmosphere account for the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d of Mars, when it came into contact with, and absorbed, more than the usual amount of water gas, creating a greenhouse effect, as well as warming the planet and the atmosphere?\n\nVenus is the closest planet in our Solar System from another planet, the Earth, and most people are familiar with its surface, climate and even the weather. We have only the one planet to talk about, right? There are other planets for the Earth to think about.\n\nWhat is \u201cclimate science?\u201d It is a science that studies climate, weather and the climate cycle, or climate patterns. This is not \u201cclimate-changing science.\u201d It is different because it looks at the natural phenomenon, and not climate scientists create or modify it.\n\nAccording to a NASA story by Paul Hawken, one of the world\u2019s greatest advocates for reducing environmental degradation, climate scientists can look at this natural phenomenon and point to what is happening and why.\n\nHawken, the president of Earthworks, founded the Global Business Coalition on Climate Change and has been quoted as saying in a Washington Post article:\n\nClimate change is going to happen whether or not we like it. It\u2019s just a question of how much it hurts and damages the things we value. \u2026 The only certainty I see is that if the climate changes in a way that endangers the environment we\u2019re going to be on the receiving end of this change. All those numbers, in other words, are based on climate science.\n\nIs climate science that reliable?\n\nClimate scientists have been involved in the research of the greenhouse effect for some time.\n\nHawken says:\n\nThe climate scientists at NASA have contributed to some key experiments showing that without greenhouse warming it would rain less on the earth. \u2026 The key test for the greenhouse effect is whether there is a warming effect on the earth\u2019s atmosphere. We\u2019ve said repeatedly that the best way to measure the greenhouse effect is to measure how a greenhouse affects the earth\u2019s temperature. There are many experiments showing that greenhouse warming raises the temperature of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. \u2026 There are also experiments showing that without more greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, the earth would be colder.\n\nClimate scientists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in the atmosphere of Mars. There is much larger amount of water there than on Earth, and Mars would have been a lush world, filled with water and vegetation.\n\nYet Mars\u2019 atmosphere, according to the study of Mars and Venus, is about one-sixth as dense as Earth\u2019s atmosphere, one-third as dense as Titan\u2019s atmosphere, about half as dense as Mars\u2019 atmosphere, and no heavier than the atmosphere of Venus. (The average density of Venus\u2019 atmosphere and the atmosphere of Titan is less than that of Mars).\n\nA question that comes to our minds is, \u201cHow many layers would Venus have?\u201d And then:\n\nAnswering that question requires a detailed model of Venus\u2019 atmosphere as a function of altitude and density. To answer it we first need to know a few fundamental conditions that exist in the Venusian atmosphere. To estimate what layers would exist in Venus\u2019 atmosphere it is necessary to make an educated guess as to what the atmosphere might be to start with and we cannot do that very accurately \u2026 It should be obvious that it would be impossible to determine the relative composition of the Venusian atmosphere without knowing the density and temperature profile of the gas in question.\n\nVenus\u2019 atmosphere has a temperature of about 450 kelvins, and a density of about 0.9 g/cc. So the first layer, Venus\u2019 atmosphere\u2019s first layer, is about 20 percent hotter than the surrounding air (450 kelvins is 1,250 degrees F). And the next layer is the first layer of density just below the first layer. So the next layer below the first layer of about 7,000 m/s of air is a layer with temperature of about 450K and density", "label": 1, "id": 100624}

They will also be in much better financial circumstances as they exit administration.\n\nAston Villa\n\nManager: Dean Smith\n\nThe 35-year old has now notched up six signings from Championship teams in 12 years as a player, coach, and manager, and his first signing is a replacement for the departing Adam Johnson, who has retired from The Whites.\n\nJohnson went into management with Manchester City, where he won two titles, but it was difficult, as he had to build from scratch with the Premier League giants, and his record at Villa has always been a mixed one at best.\n\nHe is yet to match the four league wins in three seasons, and with his departure the club have started from the back foot for the first time since 2010. He has also only kept two clean sheets for the club in that time, when he was in charge; he took charge for the first time in 2006, so perhaps the expectation of Villa becoming title contenders has come a little too early for manager Smith, particularly as the team looks to be in for a relegation battle this time next month.\n\nWolves\n\nDean Smith is keen to build a new-look squad, following the sale of three players, and has already strengthened the midfield with Scott Malone, and with three new arrivals in Aaron McLean, Gary Hooper and Danny Batth, the Wolves boss is hoping they can challenge for the next decade.\n\nSmith has already added a creative forward, which he was in favour of, in Danny Batth; he wants to take a more attacking approach with the team to try and get back to Europe following their disastrous season so far. A new striker will be key to this; with the signings of Hooper and Malone in their recent run of success, it means there is not time for someone to step into the side, as they did for Johnson last year.\n\nThe striker who came onboard with the club, and could be an automatic choice for Smith, is 19-year-old Jordan Rhodes. Rhodes came to the Wolves from the Championship side Rochdale of the English Football League.

{"text": "The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks forming over long periods of time through the deposition of sediments, the rock contains a range of mineral assemblages, the composition and relative proportions of which affect the mechanical properties of the rock. The principle of inclusions and components has been a focus of interest in geochemical research due to its key role in understanding and predicting the mechanisms of transport of minerals and other rock-forming elements through the crust. Inclusions are present in the form of small minerals or, more complex and typically are less than 0.5 mm (\u03bcm) in size, whilst components are present at the nano (0.5\u2013100 nm) and cm (100\u201310 m) scales. Many modern inclusions and components are complex organic molecules from the organisms that built and inhabited the sediments that formed them, for example, fossils. Inclusions and components are of major interest given their key role in providing constraints on geological and paleontological processes and in modelling sediment transport and other physical processes in the subsurface ([@R11], [@R12]).\n\nMany geological bodies in the Earth such as, ophiolites, mantle plumes, and metasediments possess inclusions, especially those formed by fossilized sediments. These inclusions are especially valuable when geologists study the fossil record, as are many minerals and rocks from the continental crust, such as, gabbros, granites, limestones, dolomites, schists and quartzites ([@R5]; [@R1]; [@R6]). The mineral assemblage and composition of fossiliferous sedimentary rocks from the carbonate platform of Nankai Trough, Japan can be particularly informative in understanding geological processes. Previous studies using SEM and petrography have noted distinctive morphologies of fossil inclusions, for example, angular ([@R12]), ellipsoidal ([@R13]), oval, round and cylindrical ([@R14]), and also of fossil components, for example, organic remains ([@R2]).\n\nThe aim of this work was to document the mineral phases that were present in the Cretaceous rocks of Nankai Trough of western Japan. The focus is on the mineral assemblages within inclusions (the inclusions themselves are not described in this paper). Previous studies by our team have identified the mineral phases of several of these minerals, which have been analysed using both X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and electron microscopy (EM) ([@R3]--[@R5]). In some cases, the mineral phases have been shown to have their origin in inorganic components ([@R3]). In the case of the iron-pyritic mica group, we have identified the mineral phases of the anorthoclase, orthoclase and olivine types ([@R4]). However, we have also documented the absence of the mineral of the phlogopite type in some specimens, and that of the zingite type in some others. The mineral phases of the iron-pyritic mica group are rarely found in inclusions, however, this does not detract from the importance of these minerals to geological interpretation as, we believe, their mineralogy has been heavily influenced by the inclusions they have been cemented into, which can cause significant changes in their morphologies ([@R13]). The results here describe the mineral composition and relative proportions of the mineral phases that were identified in the Nankai Trough inclusions, which has been a focus of previous studies of this region to improve our understanding of the geological processes and processes involved in the processes that underlie geological processes (see, for example, [@R10]; [@R7]).\n\nThe Nankai Trough sits within the Japan Trench in the East Pacific Rise of the Southern Alps of western Japan, located between the Japanese islands of Hokkaido and Honshu (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Its geological origin lies at the eastern edge of the East Pacific Rise (or East Japan Trench) region of the East Pacific Rise ([@R8]). The geological history of Nankai Trough is a relatively young geological feature, with the majority of the rocks forming within the southernmost portion of this region deposited from \\~1 to \\~5 ma, following the formation of Japan during the Cretaceous (\\~140 to \\~110 Ma), with a few younger rocks deposited within the same period on the inner edge of the East Japan Trench, forming the North Kanto Basin. During this period, the central part of Japan moved to the western edge of the East Japan Trench, along the North Kyushu Trench and ultimately northwards into the Central Honshu Basin ([@R8]; [@R11]).

{"text": "constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations were used to study solutions of sodium alginate oligomers formed by the cross-linking of two sodium alginate molecules. The oligomers formed by a high-molecular-weight sodium alginate have a high concentration of low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers and a lower concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers. We observed the formation of alginate network in aqueous solutions, when the system is kept at a high temperature (80\u00b0C) for 15 minutes. After the first period of the network formation (for 15--35 minutes) the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomer is small and increases exponentially, while the concentration of low-concentration small soluble oligomers has a linear function to time. Then, the high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers reach a stationary value, which means that alginate networks are formed and the average diameter of the formed networks is 2 \u03bcm. This time of formation is in agreement with available reports \\[[@pone.0204961.ref013], [@pone.0204961.ref022]--[@pone.0204961.ref024]\\]. The network formation (formation of soluble alginate oligomers) is a dynamic process and depends on the temperature and the water-entropic nature of the alginate solution. When the system is cooled, the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers increases exponentially, while the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers increases linearly \\[[@pone.0204961.ref010]\\]. This process is known as the re-entrapment of the low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers \\[[@pone.0204961.ref025]\\]. The presence of the soluble and insoluble alginate oligomers can affect the properties of the formed network with a negative impact on the gel strength (due to the swelling of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers). Additionally, because of a better solubilization of the large alginate oligomers during the formation of stable network, it is important to form stable networks during the synthesis time, when large amounts of re-entrapment of the low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers occurs. The system of re-entrapment of the large soluble oligomers occurs when the temperature is increased; such process can reduce or eliminate the formation of the insoluble oligomer aggregates and can help the formation of a stable network of alginate \\[[@pone.0204961.ref015]\\]. Formation of alginate networks by the cross-linking of two sodium alginate molecules has other advantages, first, since the networks have a large surface area (it can absorb many of the water molecules), second, these networks have a good mechanical property which makes them better for biomedical coating (as they are made of alginate, they can be used as injectable hydrogel or are insoluble to degradation by chemical substances such as ethanol \\[[@pone.0204961.ref016]\\]. It was shown that formation of alginate network by the cross-linking of sodium alginate with sodium citrate in organic solvents yields films with the lowest compression modulus, which is the reason for the use of such a preparation method in biomedical applications \\[[@pone.0204961.ref013]\\].\n\nThe results showed that at 80\u00b0C, a stable alginate network was formed between the cross-linked sodium alginate oligomers. The diameter of the formed alginate network was approximately 2 \u03bcm. In the case of sodium alginate with a high concentration, and at 90\u00b0C, an extremely dynamic process was observed: the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was greater than the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers. At the same conditions and temperature, the concentration of the soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was greater, at times, was equal to the concentration of the high-molecular-weight oligomers. An exponential increase in the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was observed at 80 and 90\u00b0C, while the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers remained constant.\n\nIn other words, in both cases (80\u00b0C for 15 min and 90\u00b0C for 15 minutes) the concentration of the high-content of alginate oligomers increases after a decrease, after 15 minutes of the alginate polymerization; these changes in osmotic pressure can occur in the liquid phase and thus can affect the physical parameters of the alginate solution.

{"text": "the nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding unsolved problems in modern physics. There seems no simple answer as to the question of whether dark matter is composed or not of any material substance, or even if it is composed at all. All attempts to make dark matter particles from elementary particles are expected to fail when confronted with the problem of quantum field theory on non-interacting particles. Therefore, they are not expected to provide useful information about its properties, such as the energy density and the pressure, and hence the total matter content and the equation of state (see Ref.\u00a0[@wmap] for experimental information). At some point some new physics may come up, which could lead to the understanding of dark matter. An example of such new physics is the weak-scale supersymmetry, see for example Refs.\u00a0[@super].\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems unlikely that we can reach the point to establish the theory of dark matter. Therefore, one must consider alternative hypotheses for its nature. For instance, one can postulate the existence of non-baryonic stars composed mostly of cold atomic nuclei\u00a0[@nuclei]. Moreover, dark matter may be realized as some form of cold weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or, alternatively, as a modification of baryonic matter such as non-relativistic fermionic dark matter\u00a0[@fDM] or bosonic weakly interacting massive particles\u00a0[@BosDM].\n\nDespite the different hypothesis for the nature of the dark matter particles, all such theories must describe the data released so far with a common dark matter mass.\n\nAnother possibility for the nature of dark matter particles is the existence of exotic or supersymmetric particles\u00a0[@extrad]. However, in general, all the ideas discussed above are based on a theory of dark matter. The main difference between these theories and the standard model concerns dark matter density. In particular, for supersymmetric and extended models, the present dark matter density is not predicted\u00a0[@extrad].\n\nConclusions\n===========\n\nCosmology is a relatively new field that gives us an unique opportunity to use some very powerful theories related to particle physics for understanding fundamental laws of our Universe.\n\nFirst, we have considered the big bang model, which has been considered for the analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis, nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation. We started from the assumption that matter had the properties of an ideal gas at extremely high temperatures or ultra-relativistic conditions, then we derived the main assumptions necessary to reconstruct the initial conditions of the Universe, as well as the temperature and pressure conditions that are required for big bang nucleosynthesis and the formation of the hot big-bang galaxies. In addition, we also considered the problem of dark matter.\n\nWe suggested three possible types of dark matter, weakly, non-covariant or non-covariant-nonhomogeneous. The main characteristic for all types of dark matter is their nature as dark matter. We focused on the non-mimetic scenario and in particular considered the cosine form. We presented observational effects of such a form, and in particular we discussed how cosmological observations can distinguish a cosine form of dark matter from a cosmological constant dark energy. We also proposed two more types that could account for dark matter.\n\nWe discussed some cosmological problems related to the dark matter, such as the question of how to explain the large-scale structure of the Universe and how to explain the small-scale effects in the early universe. Also, we looked briefly at some alternative proposals for dark matter and discussed their cosmological potential.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that we would like the reader to take time to go to the website <http://home.weizmann.ac.il/xavier.marcoso/matematicas.html> to find out more information about the papers of this series.\n\n[99]{} J.

{"text": "Diabetes Type 3\u2014which is regarded as \"brain\" specific diabetes\u2014is a combination of three disorders: (a) type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas and liver cannot effectively secrete insulin (also referred to as insulin resistance); (b) a deficiency of insulin production in the brain, which then produces high levels of insulin, or hypoglycemia; * * *. If it is the first symptom, it is called Type 1 diabetes; and if it is the only symptom, it is called Type 2 diabetes. Since you have Type 1 Diabetes, you have high blood glucose in the blood * * *.

If you don't have insulin, it goes up * * *\n\nWhy is type 3 a concern?\n\nIn Type 3A diabetes as a \"specific complication of the type 2 diabetes,\" the pancreas produces less of insulin than it used to. As insulin is produced with less concentration, insulin and sugar (glucose) are released together. When that happens, the type 3A forms: * * * A. the hypoglycemic pattern that causes short of breath and weakness that progresses to collapse and coma. Patients have a rapid drop in the blood glucose level, with severe and dangerous drops in blood pressure. * * * B. in the brain, resulting in memory changes, mood swings and a rapid decline in mental capacity. * * *\n\nIn Type 3B, the patient has a relative increase in blood sugar.

To a certain extent, we can prevent that by taking insulin, but that is not a complete solution\u2014especially in an elderly patient, who can be sensitive to the blood sugar changes. However, the most important thing is to decrease the sugar concentration the brain has with our meals.\n\nWhy is the risk from type 3 the concern for Type 2?\n\nThe diabetes risk for Type 2 does not depend on the insulin concentration in the blood; if one's pancreas produces less insulin, then an increase in the sugar levels occurs, as happens in the type 2 diabetes. * * * If you live with Type 2 diabetes, you can prevent the occurrence of a hypoglycemic event by eating the right meal: eat the meal when you are hungry. Also, don't drink water with an hour or two of no-food times in the afternoon or morning. Also, have a snack after dinner; eat a snack every two to three hours between meals. * * *\n\nWhat's the \"lifestyle change\" that the patient will be required to make?\n\nThe lifestyle changes that we need to make involve not only insulin and diet, but also changes in sleeping, exercise, smoking and alcohol use. The changes are shown in the lifestyle profile for Type 2 diabetes (Figure 25-6). The patient also has to learn to self-manage his own health, as mentioned earlier. * * * If you are diabetic, you can't eat food that contains too much carbohydrate, or you can't exercise at high intensity at least one of three days per week. * * * It's difficult to find other changes that you can make. * * *\n\nWhat are the risk factors for heart disease in Type 2 diabetes?\n\nThe following are coronary risk factors for the long-term risk of heart disease in Type 2 diabetes:\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nAge\n\nBody mass index\n\nBlood pressure\n\nBlood glucose before the age of 40 years (A1C in adults)\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nFigure 25-5 shows the lifestyle change plans for the type 2 person who is 65 or over (B) and 75 or over (C).

Thank you for this presentation. I am very happy to hear from you these last few years because my time as a Buddhist monk was much too short. I do come from a Buddhist background, but have long known and revered the traditions, precepts, and teachings of many different teachers and teachers.\n\nSo I am very happy.\n\nBuddhism is a very personal and spiritual tradition and is most definitely still quite young. Most of the time we are in touch with our teachers, and most of us know our lineage, but this is only for a few years of our lives, a few decades at the most.\n\nIt is in this context that I give you what I think are the main lines of my teachings given in the first four volumes of \u201cThe Middle Way,\u201d which are in four parts.\n\n\u201cAt that time the Buddha gave these four discourses. They comprise both a series of teachings, and the foundation, from which one could derive any knowledge.\n\nWith regard to the discourses on the Buddha\u2019s way, how he taught his disciples the ultimate truth and how those teachings could be transformed so that their application will become a means of attaining liberation.\n\nWith regard to the discourses on the Four Noble Truths, how the Four Noble Truths could be realized in any way. Then with regard to the Discourse on the Path.\n\nHow the Path could be realized, and how those practices and paths can help us transform our habits and mental formations, and make life more meaningful and more productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Discourse on the Buddha\u2019s Way of teaching can be divided into the parts it begins with. The first part, which concerns the nature of the mind and the nature of mind states.\n\nThe second part, which concerns impermanence, and the three marks of existence. Then what follows concerns the path, how it can be developed, how it can be transformed, how to attain the goal of liberation, how to lead the way to liberation. The end of the middle way is the wisdom that arises through wisdom.\n\nThen what follows are two discourses on the Four Noble Truths. These teachings are all, one sees, extremely short. They have been taken from the First Turning and are presented in four categories, because there are four aspects of the teachings. The first set of four goes through the teachings of a number of teachers. The second set of four then shows the four truths in the light of a number of traditions.\n\nThe last set of four deals with the end of the Four Noble Truths, the wisdom that arises at the end of this whole process of transformation, which is the final wisdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Four Noble Truths,\u201d which were presented in this way, first were presented as an eight-fold way of understanding.\n\nThere was also a further four-fold way, which was presented in terms of the four \u201cdharmas.\u201d\n\nSo there is no need to translate these teachings. These four noble truths and the Four Noble Truths, the four aspects of the Four Noble Truths, can be translated as follows:\n\n1. Mind is empty.

{"text": "This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence, which I still see whenever the credits roll, featured what felt like a scene from James Bond. An arm holding a box of money in the air as it is thrown from the window of the moving vehicle (the camera\u2019s downward movement, then up and back to re-position the box in the frame, is also reminiscent of a Bond car chase). The shot of the box falling towards the ground, at the very beginning of the movie itself, felt like something out of one of Bond\u2019s films, which I guess goes along with the theme.\n\nHowever, when the movie starts, what I found most surprising was the plot and how it was executed. It\u2019s not very long, but the story is well crafted, and the acting is amazing. The film itself could have easily passed for a classic, but the director has put a lot of effort into building the storyline, so you\u2019re invested in the whole thing. Even the title of the film is clever: The Other Ones. The film is set in the future (about 5,000 years in the future), but also involves the time frame in which John Connor (Jared Leto) is born.\n\nThe plot is about what happens when the first group of humans (the ones that make up the main cast) arrive in what they call the \u201cCity of Light\u201d (the term coined by Leto\u2019s character) and the second group of humans goes in the \u201cCity of Dark,\u201d which is something completely different. Because Leto is biracial, he also has a strong connection to both worlds (his character is the \u201cOther,\u201d the one who is a mix of \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d in nature, and is therefore a mixture of \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d with only a few shades separated for the purposes of the story). Leto\u2019s character (\u201cJohn Connor\u201d) is a man with amazing abilities, but he is not normal. In the words of his love-interest (\u201cAnna\u201d), who is also a character from the Future of the series, \u201cNo one can see his true gifts.\u201d\n\nLeto\u2019s character is not normal because of the way that his heart is a pure love for a beautiful, dark-haired woman. I won\u2019t say her name here, but she might as well be called \u201cCatherine.\u201d\n\nThis man is a very unique and special being and if you thought he was ordinary, the movie\u2019s main character will blow your mind. So how did it all happen? I was really surprised by the story and the acting, but not the technical aspects of the film. It was quite a fun ride in a very interesting plot, and I hope it lives on past its initial run. It\u2019s a very unique and compelling world, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.\n\nLogan (Hugh Jackman) was brought to the future to be trained by an artificial intelligence for his \u201cspecial task\u201d to be a father. He\u2019s going to teach his son about the world in which they live, what humans know and what does they don\u2019t know. We know that this is a family business because of all the time they spend apart for their jobs at \u201cMakoTech,\u201d the corporation that is responsible for training all human children for their \u201cjobs.\u201d\n\nI was a bit skeptical about the futuristic aspect of the movie because to me, it seems a bit out dated. However, the movie does not just throw some of the tropes that were prevalent in the \u201cMatrix\u201d and \u201cTerminator\u201d (at the time of their releases) from the past over the fence and into the future, it uses them to tell a very different plot. The futuristic aspect of the film actually has quite a bit of weight to it, to put it simply.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to define the three main characters, Logan (Hugh Jackman), Kate Austen (Kate Mara), and their company (the film\u2019s title is a nod to the popular book \u201cThe City of Light,\u201d but I won\u2019t go into it here). This is not your typical family drama. I am a bit biased when I say this, but I find all human stories a bit one sided and not very realistic (I always think of the old \u201cSaggy Pants\u201d cartoon). You know, when an action scene begins in a shot before it even starts? That\u2019s a good representation of family drama. Like my parents always said to me, \u201cLet me tell you a little story.\u201d Now I am just going to steal that and say my parents always told me a story, they", "label": 1, "id": 100635}

{"text": "The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have had a relatively low income. In 1598, one of the best scholars in Europe at the age of forty-seven was appointed as an official for the Ming court in Hangzhou. The position of military official, one of the most prestigious and lucrative posts, entailed a high salary and the requirement to give a year-long salary to the governor. The average salary for a member of a Mongol garrison family of that era ranged from 3,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan per year. The salary for a middle-class man would have been 1,600 yuan, less than half of that for a member of the ruling elite of the dynasty. Moreover, the Mongol garrison was an army of horsemen with few weapons and no armour. The soldiers in the garrison would have been trained as horsemen, but without the military discipline that would have been required at the fighting frontier for the Qing army at that time.\n\nAlthough an official position held by a military man was an important promotion, most of the families of the garrison would not have had enough money to support an heir. In order to get a son to join the army, families of the garrison would have to go through a long process of succession. All family members would have been required to serve as soldiers for twelve years and to contribute one year's wages on the basis of merits or family connections for each year of service. However, the government did not impose the requirement for all the sons to make contributions into the family. Only some family members would be required to give a year's wages to the government. This led to a large number of peasant children of the families of garrison stationed in the Mongolian army. During this time, with no prospects of an economic rise in the next generation, many children would be forced to work in the army. They would have been trained in the basics of military service and in fighting with lances in their father's hands.\n\nAs for the education of the youth at the age of fifteen, it would seem that the Mongol garrison did not have much to offer young people, who received either primary or common education in elementary school, and who were expected to learn martial skills to serve one's country. During the period up to the end of the Yuan dynasty, there were no Mongol soldiers who were trained as the most advanced war tactics.\n\n##  **The End of the Yuan Dynasty**\n\nThe Yuan dynasty was established on the basis of Ming dynasty after the reign of the Ming emperor Hongzhi (1271\u20131336). The emperor Hongzhi attempted to extend his power from Beijing to other territories through military intervention and negotiation with other local rulers. This was the time when many peasants were becoming increasingly discontent with the poor economic conditions and poor welfare of the Mongol garrison.\n\nAccording to some historians, the rebellion of the Hongwu emperor (1723\u20131740) and that of the Jianwen emperor (1735\u20131735) were provoked by the harsh conditions of the garrison soldiers; while on the other hand, the Ming emperor Kangxi (1722\u20131796) regarded the garrison soldiers as his best soldiers in his campaign against the revolts of the rebel Xuande and the rebel Hongshi emperor.\n\nWhen the last Yuan emperor died in 1763, he did not designate any successor. Although after his death in 1763 there had some Mongol garrison troops in different regentships, the Mongol troops stayed in their barracks. Some of them even received land titles as a reward for their military service to the Mongol government. During the early period after the death of the emperor Wanli (1762\u20131799), there were frequent attempts to assassinate the new emperor Kangxi, but the efforts were not fulfilled.\n\n##  **The Beginning of the Qing Dynasty**\n\nThe reign of the last emperor Wanli (1762\u20131799) was a period of great changes in Chinese history. Under these conditions, the Qing dynasty, with an entirely different administrative structure, came into being. The Mongol garrison, after being a part of the Chinese imperial army, no longer had any interest in serving in the Qing army. They continued to serve their local garrison towns and became the main force of local government of their towns. Under the supervision of the Qing court at that time, in an attempt to get some benefit from the former Mings, many young Mings from the Mongol garrison in Qing lands have founded new Mings. The main reasons for the decline in the Chinese power were that since the last emperor, the Ming dynasty has declined in territory and it was too weak to defend itself effectively against the invasions of the Japanese and the Mongol Empire. The last Ming emperor Yang Xiu (1641\u20131721) was succeeded by his grandchild Hongwu in the last period, and Hongwu not only had a strong interest in building and strengthening his China's ancient imperial traditions, but also had an imperial title.

Mr. Putin denied having anything to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, but he did say that Mr. Trump\u2019s business activities had brought economic benefits. He praised Mr. Trump as a strong and reliable leader. \u201cHis personality is always in an active state... he gets excited about anything,\u201d Mr. Putin said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius, a visionary.\u201d Mr. Tadic told the Australian that American intelligence officials had told him that Mr. Trump had \u201cgreat friends on the inside\u201d in Russia. \u201cHe made the decision to join the government of Russia as the head of American intelligence, and I am convinced Russia gave the Donald Trump that opportunity,\u201d Mr. Tadic said.\n\nThe Australian, 28 June, 2016On Sunday, May 16, 2016, senior intelligence officials in Washington told Trump staffers that Russian hackers were trying to influence the American election. The officials claimed the Kremlin was trying to help Mr. Trump, according to a person who was part of the chain of communications from the officials to Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met one of the senior officials at an all-hands meeting at the Trump Organization the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s first foreign visitor, Sergei Roldugin, the Russian ambassador to the United States, called Mr. Trump a man of integrity who is in contact with Russians. Mr. Roldugin was the first foreigner to meet President-elect Mr. Trump at his New York apartment building, and he was accompanied by a senior lawyer from the Kremlin, who handed him a business card with the name Moscow Prosecutor\u2019s Office on it. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his top political adviser, were initially puzzled over what the card could possibly mean. Mr. Trump told his staff in the evening, \u201cWe have to find out very clearly whether or not there was any collusion between the Russians and my campaign. Because that appeared to be the most concerning thing in all of it,\u201d according to one of the aides, who asked not to be quoted by name. Two days after the advisers gathered, the same Trump staffer received an email from a senior Russian official, who said that Mr. Trump would have much success with Russia on the election, and that Mr. Trump should consider starting a new business in Moscow. The staffer didn\u2019t understand the email at first, and passed it up to the White House, the senior Russian official said. \u201cIt was a one-line email,\u201d said one senior Russian official. \u201cA lot of information is contained on this sheet and he wanted me to pass it to Jared, from our point of view, as is usual.\u201d Several intelligence officials say they believe that the Russian government was the main force behind the hacking aimed at Mr. Trump that was first revealed earlier this year, and that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and Mr. Flynn were surprised when they found out about it only the night before the Election. One senior intelligence official said Russia\u2019s goal had been to support its favored candidate, Hillary Clinton, who was running against Bernie Sanders. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are saying that Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut I guess it\u2019s possible.\u201d The officials described the Russian effort to influence the election as a covert operation, in which the Russians would plant software on computers, or hack into their networks, and would use it on behalf of one candidate or another. They acknowledge that the hacking had potentially damaging effects on the election, but do not think Russia was ultimately responsible for it.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have determined that there was strong enough evidence from the start of the campaign that it was being affected by Russian hackers to take extraordinary steps to prevent that hacking from having any effect. There have been several attempts to assess the origin and scope of the Russian hacking, but by May 2016, the United States was able to share its findings with allied governments, a senior government official in Australia\u2019s spy agency said. On that basis, Mr. Obama decided that the evidence was compelling enough and unprecedented in its scope to warrant the extraordinary step of publicly disclosing the U.S. findings about the hacking. Although he declined comment on that point to Reuters, the president said in a statement, \u201cI authorized this as I believe that it is in the national security interest of the United States to disclose publicly the evidence of Russian interference in our upcoming election.\u201d\n\nIn March", "label": 1, "id": 100640}
{"text": "we investigate the effect of helium abundance and @xmath0-element enhancement on the abundances. In a series of papers [@Keller_2012] developed a new method of determining element abundances based on line strength ratios observed in H$\\beta$, using the data of @Henden_2015. Such a method was applied to the present data by determining a helium abundance of the order of 0.30\u20130.40 for this galaxy and a \\[C/H\\] factor of 0.30. The use of this method is limited by the need for spectral resolution better than about 0.1 \u00c5\u00a0and the difficulty in measuring the strength of carbon lines. The method cannot determine abundances below 1.8 $\\leq$ X$_{He}\\leq$ 3.1 for helium, but it can for C and N. This method is very promising for C and N measurements in distant galaxies, as the CII(1593.59 \u00c5) and CIII(2200.75 \u00c5) are observable and sensitive in the optical spectral range, which is important at least for LMC studies. We have used such a method for our target, but the accuracy of the measured He abundance is uncertain.\n\nFigure \\[fig\\_x\\*\\] presents the abundances of C, N, and He (with the He abundance derived with the method described above) as a function of the helium mass fraction, $Y_P$, for a model spectrum for an A4p simulation, using a model spectrum and photoionization models with \\[O/H\\] = 0.3, and \\[C/H\\] = 0.4. The model spectrum includes He and He, the CN lines, and He and He lines. The helium mass fractions of the model $Y_P$ = 40 %, 50 % and 60 % are the same as in the simulation. The figure shows that the carbon abundances are enhanced by about 0.3 dex, which is consistent with the abundance ratio for CN and \\[O/Fe\\]. Carbon abundances are enhanced by 0.35 dex from $Y_P$=50 %. This is larger than the 0.35 dex estimated with the CII(1770.33 \u00c5) by @Cayrel2006. There might be two reasons for this difference. First, the model spectrum considered here does not include carbon stars. Second, our determination of the helium abundance is uncertain. Figure \\[fig\\_x\\*\\] confirms that the carbon abundance is enhanced by almost the same amount from the carbon abundance. The helium mass fraction is enhanced also by approximately 0.05 dex below $Y_P$=40 %, but we see no appreciable enhancement below 60 %, at least it is not obvious in the figure. This result is also in line with the abundance ratio to CN, \\[C/H\\] (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]). We can say that the observed carbon abundance is 0.35 dex enhanced with respect to the adopted He abundance. This is larger than the abundance ratio for CN with respect to C, \\[O/Ne\\] = 0.1, and \\[C/Na\\] = 0.1 (see Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]) but it is significantly smaller than the carbon abundance enhancement of 1.0 dex of \\[C/O\\] derived by @Kobayashi2000. We are not able here to judge whether they were correct, but it is unlikely to find the nitrogen-enhanced C abundance, such as the nitrogen abundance 0.6 dex for a solar nitrogen abundance [@Asplund2009], from nitrogen enhancement in CN.\n\nThe N/O and Ne/Na ratios and carbon abundance are all more enhanced toward the center, while N/O and Ne/Na have been estimated by @Aoki_2001 to be enhanced with respect to their solar values, while there is no appreciable abundance enhancement of C in the Cepheids. The N/O and Ne/Na ratios are more enhanced toward the center than the C/O ratio (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]). As a result, the N/O and Ne/Na ratios are more enhanced than the C/O ratio.\n\nIn Paper I, we have already demonstrated that the carbon abundance increases with age and that the \\[C/O\\] ratio is approximately constant. This is not the case for neon and oxygen for LMC Cepheids, as shown in Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]. The oxygen abundance also increases with age. We now see (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]) that the C/O ratio at \\[C/O\\]=0.08 decreases slightly for the first 4.5 Gy with respect to \\[O/O\\]=0.07.

{"text": "purposethe toxicity of antiglaucoma medications to ocular surface cells has been suggested to be due to oxidation/oxidative stress. Oxidation of extracellular matrix proteins by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may cause disruption in the function and structure of the ocular surface thereby impairing the function of the ocular surface. We studied the effect and mechanisms involved of the antiglaucoma medication timolol maleate (TMO) on ocular surface cells induced by cyclo-oxygenase-2 siRNA. Primary human corneal epithelial cells were cultured in the presence of TMO. TMO was added to the cell culture system 24 hours after transfection with a sequence-specific double-stranded siRNA targeting cyclo-oxygenase-2. Cells were harvested at specific time points, and then the amounts of reactive oxygen species were determined using a fluorescein dye. Immunoblot detection of Nox2 protein expression was performed. TMO significantly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species in cyclo-oxygenase-2 siRNA-transfected cells. The reactive oxygen species production was almost completely inhibited by Nox2 siRNA, indicating that oxidation was mediated through Nox2. TMO also caused changes in expression of various components of corneal epithelial cells. The expressions of some corneal epithelial cell proteins were reduced in a similar manner to reactive oxygen species. The effect of TMO was reversed by subsequent addition of Nox2 siRNA into cell cultures. Our findings suggest that oxidation of corneal epithelial cells caused by TMO might be due to increased reactive oxygen species. The effect of oxygen radicals on the cell function depends on which reactive oxygen species is increased during oxidative damage. We propose that the mechanism of the anti-stress effect of TMO involves the inhibition of reactive oxygen species through Nox2 expression, which may also explain the therapeutic effect of TMO on ocular surface cells.", "label": 1, "id": 100643}

{"text": "THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world's most famous band, ever. The first four notes were enough to put the top musicians of the world on a mental pedestal. Even though they were born at the end of the sixties of last century, Carlos Santana and Stevie Wonder were too old to get away from the record label of his moment in time: Atlantic Records. There were other record labels, other artists, other songs, another planet. But if the records released in that era were compared to this recording, it would not be possible to find a more perfect image for the sound of the era.\n\nThe recordings began with the legendary band that came to dominate the airwaves, starting in Brazil with the record Dooinserto, by Tia Geraldo, who had been trained in her native S\u00e3o Paulo at the conservatory of the Conservatorium and, with the money she received from her recording, bought a tape recorder, and began to record her family in the small town of Campina, S\u00e3o Paulo. Tia Geraldo was very happy to have someone in a position to record the songs that she and her bandmates performed. Since that time, a small number of her songs were released to the world, among which included Ipateu, by Luiz Gonzaga. The song was one of the first with the band, but it was the first album they released. In the eighties, the same group, also in a position to record songs, recorded the same number of hits. It was the first time the two singers could be heard together in the same album and the album did very well for them.\n\nThe first album was also the last one released by the group, which at that time had seven members, and it started to change over the next eight years of the ten years the group spent together. At first, they became friends, but then the friendships shifted into full-fledged relations.\n\nIn 1986, when they recorded the album Dooinserto, they already knew each other for thirty years, since the first contact between them occurred in 1957 when Santana first met Wonder. At that time, it was at the beginning of the eighties, with Santana on the cusp of being able to produce his second album, and Wonder was on the cusp of being able to release the first of his albums. In those years, Wonder was going through a difficult period that he shared with Carlos Santana. Between 1986 and 1990, the group released seven records. The great success recorded on Dooinserto took Wonder to another level and the group recorded at a higher volume.\n\nCarlos Santana was the first to recognize it in himself. Before the song of Dooinserto, Santana sang as if he was singing with just one voice between two instruments. Even after his amazing success on Dooinserto and the albums he recorded thereafter, he would always have moments of silence during the songs, only for one or two notes to appear from the end of the song to the beginning again, and this is what happened to his voice on some of the records that followed.\n\nAfter the massive success of Dooinserto, Wonder, in those years, had a personal success that was also personal, and he released a new album. It was a collection of all his hit songs. The first album he released posthumously had a song that no one had ever heard before, and was the song of what was to be the next big hit, \"Alibi\", with Bibi, one of the female members of Santana's band.\n\nAs I was saying, Wonder was the first to recognize in himself the quality of the work produced by the group. He realized that the next one was going to be even greater. The next album, released in 1990, was very successful, reaching platinum status in the United States. In Brazil the album was named Supernova, and for three years. However, Wonder's career seemed to be about to end and his manager, Ed King, who had never stopped trying to get Wonder to make a new album, wanted to keep him with a small group that he already had. After the first album, the band had seven members, and after one year of working with only five of the members, it seemed that only one would continue to be part of the band.\n\nThe other members had their difficulties to deal with, too. There was the feeling that, whatever they did, things were going to turn down the hill, and Santana finally stopped working with the band. On the same year, the great group he founded to support Wonder began to record songs that they recorded for the first time. Wonder's song became the first single, \"The Way You Rock Me\", by The Fugees, and also it was the title on their album, which quickly became a hit, the album selling over twenty million cds in the US alone", "label": 1, "id": 100645}

'I'm the only thing there!'\n\nI looked up at the tower and wondered why the people building it hadn't considered the people on the hill before building it. We are all equal on the hill.\n\nAs I continued along the hill in one direction, I was met by the sound of a fire engine in the other. It was all rather odd, and my instincts kicked in to tell me this was not a good look. There was still light enough to see by.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, I got the courage to call the station on my cellphone. I had been thinking about ringing the police so I had left the house fully expecting to put up my alarm to take over the task of getting me home. That was until the light on my cellphone went out. I was able to say the last four numbers of my cellphone into the phone. I managed to give the officers in charge the whole of my address \u2013 but I didn't want to tell them any other information. The officers were a bit surprised when I explained. They said that in two or three days time they would be getting round to it. I assured them that would be all right but in the meantime I thought I would ask for a bit longer than two days. They agreed, and said they would have it in their notes. They thanked me for making the call and wished me luck before I took off back down into the village.\n\nIt was now well after midnight. I started walking \u2013 it was getting dark earlier now. I walked down the road until I came round to the front of the Tesco store. I took my own groceries home in my car. They were for my mother who was in hospital.\n\n_**Sunday, 11 May, 10th Floor, Tesco:**_ I went to the Tesco store when I came back home to pick up my groceries \u2013 they were all still at the checkout and I had to be in my office before the staff knew that I was on my way back. I thought I had left my phone in work.\n\nWhen I arrived back in my office I opened up my email and then looked at it again. I thought there had been an email from my wife and then I remembered hearing her phone ring and thinking she was waiting for me to pick it up so I left my office and went back to grab hold of my phone. I saw that I had three texts from her and it wasn't even one of them from her.\n\nI hadn't thought about those texts in the car home. I had put the keys in the ignition thinking that it wasn't going to happen. Once I arrived home I was in too much of a hurry to start the car. I walked back into the house to find my phone in one of my coat pockets. My mother was in hospital \u2013 that's the phone call I hadn't made in the first place \u2013 in fact, I had not even thought about it and as far as I knew I left my phone in my office on my desk \u2013 I was already in the wrong. I looked at the time on the email. 9:40. I was late \u2013 I had got to the point in my day where I couldn't believe what everyone was telling me was true. My wife knew I didn't have my phone, at least she thought I didn't. She knew I had left it in work. She could sense my depression. I had a big mountain of emails on my desk that I was going to end up with. She had a theory that I had been with a girl. I'd been going through hell. As I stood there holding the phone I saw she had looked at the time of her calls and realized she had called me at eleven o'clock and that it was only four. In a way, the thing that had struck her with was I hadn't answered. She saw me go back into my office and open the desk drawer and she thought I had gone to get the key to my office. I was in agony. I had spent my Saturday night at home. I couldn't face going back into work, it was all I could think about. I went to the bedroom and took out a bottle of wine and went back in to my office. The door shut out the light but I switched on my laptop on the bed and I was using the bottle to see if the emails would come through. My boss was having a party at the end of the week.

I walk out to the water's edge with a bag full of old clothes, the kind made of material like terry cloth, which I think I will return to the seamstresses on my return. Then I decide I will hitch south and head back to Amsterdam. Hoekstra will never stop looking at me, and it is hard to leave him. But I am starting to wish my journey had been longer.\n\nHoekstra stands at the stern and waves at me, his hands on his hips, his red sneakers a little unsteady against the hard gray granite of the marina walls. In his red nylon jacket he is a faded version of himself.\n\nHoekstra knows where I am from.

She has on jeans and a pink polo of the type men sometimes wear in the fall. Both of them seem not to notice my presence. I think I will leave them for a few more minutes. Hoekstra takes my elbow and guides me towards him. I look down at the marina, which has long ago been transformed into a giant green golf course. Soon the marina has disappeared, and only the green and blue of the sky remains. I feel like a ship's ball, or a marconi. We walk and walk and the world stretches ahead of us like a long tunnel between the green and blue of the sky.\n\nWe walk for a long time, to the point where, as Hoekstra leads me, I do not feel like turning around or walking back, even if I could move again.\n\nHoekstra suddenly takes my elbow in his hand and I look up into his face. I have been following him since morning and have not seen him look away or put his head down, as he would have when he was embarrassed. I am starting to think he is ashamed of me, as much as he was ashamed of me when I was young and my father was a pastor. Suddenly my old pride rises again.\n\n\"Jozef's mother has been dead for many years.\"\n\n\"Why do you call him J\u00f3zef?\" I stop walking and turn to face Hoekstra.\n\n\"I like the sound of it,\" he says. \"It means 'lover of the sea.' \" He opens his arms wider.\n\nMy arm is now touching his shoulders. Hoekstra smiles as I look up at his face. His hair is longer now and his cheekbones are a little sharper than they are in this moment. It has been a long day and the sun has already gone down. I turn to look along the narrow strip of the harbor, where he smiles and leans over again with an arm around me.\n\n\"The ocean is where I live.

{"text": "In Britain, Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork, and in the 17th & 18th century, most art historian thought that Norman sculptors did not sculpt in marble. Today, the use of marble in sculpture has been accepted as an art form. Sculptors created stone sculpture with great skill, such as that in Caen stone and carved stone. In recent times, it was discovered that many works of the early French sculptors, like L\u00e9onard de Vinci in his garden, also had a use of marble. These discoveries were recorded by Sir Arthur Evans, who published his study \u201cThe Decorative Arts of the British Museum\u201d in 1934.\n\nThe Normans\nThe Normans swept into Britain in the first part of the 11th century. The history of the English invasion from northern France includes battles, battles and more battles. The Norman conquest of England was a prolonged war of succession and conquest. Although the Normans had some fighting on the battlefields they did not take the land, nor did they want to. The invaders established a new kingdom of England and Wales. The land they took is sometimes called Britain, the land of the English or simply England from today\u2019s standpoint.\n\nEngland in the Middle Ages\nThe country was occupied by different warlords during the 13th, 14th and 17th centuries. The power and glory of the British Isles remained largely intact, apart from what came later. The economy was mainly agrarian, trade was at a low level, and towns were small and self-sufficient. At that time, England was a small, very poor country, with only some cities.\n\nNorman art\n\nIn Norman period, stone was produced as building material and architectural sculpture, but also for other functions. Norman architecture combined the features of Romanesque with new features, in some ways similar to the Gothic style that followed in the second half of the 13th century. Stone statues are often found in Norman stone buildings, as a sign of status, or for their beauty. Medieval stone was the most commonly used building material \u2013 stone floors, stone pillars, stone walls, stone roofs.\n\nThe main building material on earth was wood and other building materials that have a combination of strength and light weight suitable for constructing buildings or sculptures and can often withstand heat and moisture. The strength of wood was greatly valued during all periods of history, as evidenced by its use in weapons and in ship construction. At the time of the Norman Conquest, the best wood in England was oak, and many large buildings included the trunks of that tree.\n\nWood was first extensively used in architecture in Italy in the 10th century, and the timber used for construction in England has evolved in a similar direction ever since, with different kinds for different functions.\n\nSculpture\nMany large stone statues were sculpted for the decoration of walls, doors, arches, windows and so on, or for the statues of saints and angels, to decorate the sanctuary of churches. These statues stood in the main room of a building of some kind (typically a basilica), along with the statue on the high altar, or in the main chapel of a cathedral. Some of the statues were in statuesque position, whereas others were in more sober profile view.\n\nA large number of statues of historical figures were created. Some statues have been restored, but most are in the process of restoration today. There were two major styles, the round, and the square or oblong.\n\nThe round statues with the feet pointing towards the center of the statues, where the head is located.\n\nSculptures in large reliefs have been called polychrome statues. They were carved in two colors, either marble or stone colors, and sometimes were made in polychrome style.\n\nSculptures in rectangular form with the head positioned to the right side of the sculpture were called trapeziels, \u201ctrapezoids\u201d. Those with the head on the left side of the statue were considered \u201cdrapers\u201d, \u201cdrapiers\u201d, \u201cbattiers\u201d or \u201cbatteurs\u201d.\n\nSculptures with the body to the right were called \u201carches\u201d or \u201cportables\u201d, and those with the body to the left were considered \u201cmantelets\u201d or \u201clancetors\u201d.\n\nSculptures standing in the center of an architectural space were called \u201ctables\u201d or \u201ctablestairs\u201d where the head is positioned at a lower altitude, usually at the center of the entrance door of a house.\n\nSculptures in columns (or arches) were called \u201ccolumns\u201d, or \u201ccolumnar\u201d because of their architectural function, when they were part of a building.

It is a very good read, I have never read or will read her books in their entirety. The movie, however, makes very little sense. In my opinion, the point to make is this: what will happen when young teenagers get to experience the adult world, and that is not for them to determine. I don't know what the solution is, but I do know that it is not to be in young people's hands.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nWell said! I liked what your friend said and I agree 100%. It's what happens after they leave that matters more.\n\nAs for The Hunger Games--one thing I can't understand is how they thought it would be successful when it clearly was not. It's been shown at least three (non sequiturs) since its production that it is a joke.\n\nI never went to see the movie I read about last week. The movie and the book are two of about ten books I have read by Anne Rice, and I read the book.\n\nI went to the movies last year when J.K Rowling premiered the Harry Potter series. I sat there with a woman who had just watched the series. I wondered what was wrong with the movie. I have no idea, but it was the same for us (and the woman said she liked the movie).\n\nI don't really want to be here today and see the movie. I hope someone can give me an explanation. I liked the books and the movie, but I can't tell you why.\n\nI want to know why it so bad. And I did like it. I did not feel like some big secret was hidden from me. I did not feel as though I was going to die. I felt like a normal person being shown. I feel like Anne Rice was a real person instead of a fictional one.\n\nI read the books and would like it if it would make a good movie.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI thought I did, but I could not be sure, which is why I tried to find out about it.\n\nI did like the movie, and I still want to read all of her books, and I did find out some things, but I didn't like what was told about the other books.\n\nI don't think I should get too upset, like you did.

At the transition from the chromosphere and the transition region to the corona, the CR electron acceleration and transport coefficients have to be modified. A modified set of transport coefficients ($\\alpha$) has been constructed by using the acceleration and transport parameters for electrons and the acceleration and transport parameters for protons in the transition region and corona, and using the mean magnetic topology and CR electron energy spectrum obtained from the observations on the solar surface and the lower corona.\n\nTo model the transition from the lower corona to the upper corona, the CR electron number density profile in the low corona of a solar flare is taken to be the function of vertical height $Z$ instead of the distance $r$ from the disk centre. We consider the flare (solar storm) with maximum of $\\sim$ 2% of total CR flux, which is a typical case. The number density of electrons at 10 R$_\\odot$ during a solar flare has been calculated by means of the analytical solution and the numerical code described in [@2000SSRv...95..161D].\n\nOur analysis starts with the following assumptions: 1) in the lower chromosphere and the transition region the non-relativistic (i.e. $k_g=0$) and relativistic ($k_g=\\infty$) solutions of the Klein-Nishina and R.S. Bohm diffusion equations are equivalent. 2) The transport of relativistic CR electrons is efficient in the lower chromosphere and the transition region (as in the case of relativistic particles like muons and electrons) and inefficient ($\\alpha=0.5$ and $\\alpha=2$) in the corona, where the typical height of the transition region is assumed to be $Z=50$ R$_\\odot$. 3) During the passage through the corona with $Z<50$ R$_\\odot$, the CR electrons (in the CR transport case) escape with a rate of $\\alpha$ from the source region and travel with the velocity of $|v-c|$. 4) The CR electrons are distributed along the radial direction from the source region with the power law energy distributions $$f_\\mathrm{CR,Z<50}(E_{\\mathrm{CR}})=\\gamma(E_{\\mathrm{CR}}{Z})^{-\\delta}\\,,\\quad\n\\gamma=0.5,\\delta=0.25.$$ Above the radius $Z=50$ R$_\\odot$ the electrons are distributed with another power law energy distribution in a range of lower energies $eE_{100})$ where $e$ is a small (and finite) number, $$f_\\mathrm{CR,Z>50}(E_{\\mathrm{cr}})=\\gamma(E_{\\mathrm{cr}}{Z})^{-\\delta}\\,,\\quad\n\\gamma=1\\,,\\quad e=1.$$\n\nThe CR electrons are considered to have power law energies $E_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ from the interval of $10^4$ to $10^3$ keV (the corresponding energy intervals in the range of a few 10 keV are similar.)

But if it follows through on that, other European countries will follow, and \u201cwe will not make Russia's problem that much bigger,\u201d said senior Cabinet minister Julian Fantino, adding that NATO would then have to respond. \u201cWe will be forced to take action in order to maintain the unity of Europe,\" he said. The move marks the most forceful condemnation yet of Russia's actions, including the support of pro-Russia forces in Ukraine. Mr. Fantino said it wasn't only the Ukrainian government that was behind Russian moves, but also a significant number of governments in Europe and the United States. \"We will continue to go down this road if it continues. But I think it would be in our interest to move to a much more effective response,\" he said. NATO said its decision to confront Russia was based on the information it has at hand as well as information it had received after meeting Ukrainian leaders. \u201cIn the event Russia further demonstrates that it will act with impunity by directly supporting the overthrow of a democratic government, all NATO member states are prepared to consider potential follow-on responses,\u201d said a NATO statement. President Barack Obama said in a statement that the U.S. has been trying \u201csince day one to avoid any escalation in the situation,\u201d but stressed that this decision had not been forced on him. \u201cIf Russia fails to live up to its commitments, other countries may decide that it is necessary for their own security interests to take additional steps,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat this means, of course, is that there is absolutely no chance of Russia backing down. Indeed, the response (or worse) is already in the making. Russia has been hit with a series of sanctions for its destabilizing action in Georgia, and this time, it won't be able to claim its actions were isolated incidents and then try to wriggle off the hook. The move is also going to force European countries to react.\n\nWhat's the rush, though? This is not the first time a U.S. administration has stepped up the pressure on Russia. The U.S. has been demanding that Russia cease its support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine, and for supporting the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Why start over when there already is a precedent?\n\nActions by the U.S. include sanctions against Russian oligarchs and its government. Other countries follow suit, and the U.S. can't afford to go down without a fight. It's just a matter of time until some other European country joins in, either in order to further their own strategic goals or because of a sense of national mission.\n\nSo they do it with a stroke - with a full frontal military attack against Russia, they'll likely force that country to respond. The EU will likely do the same in order to preserve a semblance of unity around the world, because a united Europe is the key to preventing a major war from breaking out.\n\nThe EU has taken action in the past when Russia's intransigence was causing it problems, both in Georgia and Ukraine. It was forced to agree to a temporary ceasefire with Russia to protect its citizens and for Russia to agree to a cease fire for Ukraine.\n\nThis time, though, the threat of a NATO response gives Russia no choice but to respond.\n\nIf the world didn't want to go to war, then the situation would be different, just more diplomatic action involving Russia, Europe and the U.S. Russia would have had much more leeway to respond to U.S. pressure, and the world would be on to the next stage in the conflict. This action means a war will break out when Russia has little choice.\n\nThere is no justification for NATO's use of armed forces on the European continent - it only encourages aggressive behaviour, which is exactly what Russia is accused of during this crisis. But NATO is a necessary evil, and if Russia has to be \"forced\" to back down, then so be it.\n\nThere's no point in denying that Russia is a threat to Europe and the U.S. - they all see it, just as they see each other. The key will be to contain the damage - to do something that shows Russia that it has to give in. If the EU decides to cut ties with Russia, then Russia will feel the pressure, and the issue will be a moot point. However, Russia would still be able to call it an \"isolated incident\".

{"text": "First borns score higher than siblings in IQ tests as early as age two - and their moms have more influence on them.\n\nResearchers have known since the early 60s that offspring do not typically fare as well as children who share the same parentage.\n\nBut new research published Tuesday in the American Journal of Public Health suggests that the cognitive differences between brothers and sisters is not due to the inherent nature of males and females; the different environmental influences that shape our brains and lives; or the impact of nurture vs. nature.\n\n\"There is more influence on kids from moms versus dads,\" said Dr. Jennifer O'Connell, the study's lead author and an associate professor of epidemiology, of environmental sciences, and of population studies and public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University. \"It appears like moms have more of an influence on siblings and parents.\"\n\nWhen siblings are compared, moms had an effect in almost every outcome, the research said. They made an impact on boys' cognition in cognitive tasks at age two and on girls' at five. In some cases, moms had a stronger influence on girls. In other cases, moms had a much stronger impact on boys. The researchers found that these differences did not occur randomly between siblings but were often gender-specific, meaning that the mom\u2019s effect was stronger for girls but not boys.\n\nIn other words, if girls are having better cognitive scores when they are given the same test at age two, it would lead to a better score when they would take the test again at five, said O\u2019Connell.\n\nShe said that\u2019s something to be expected: It is the same test they have taken at two and five-years-old.\n\n\u201cMothers are influencing their children and they make more positive changes for kids around the time they develop. If you look at kids at two versus five, that\u2019s a pretty significant difference at the age of two,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIt is the same test they are taking when they are young, and because mother\u2019s have more influence than fathers, it seems like moms are influencing more sons\u2019 scores vs. daughters\u2019 scores.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell said the results should encourage further investigation into whether moms\u2019 influence of children has an impact on later academic achievements even after the children reach an age where those effects may be seen as diminishing.\n\nThe new research is one of several that have suggested similar effects. Another study was published last year in the Journal of Family Psychology that found mothers\u2019 influence on children\u2019s scores on IQ tests was stronger in children growing up in families with more income and wealth. As O\u2019Connell noted, the study didn\u2019t look at siblings because the older siblings may have had no influence at all on the younger ones and the researchers thought more research was needed. But the researchers who did look at siblings showed that moms\u2019 impact on younger siblings was greater than the influence on older siblings.\n\nO'Connell added to a recent New York Times article that \"the science shows that there are certain types of influence on kids.

However, the effect was small, meaning there was not significant influence.\n\nMore research is needed to figure out the nature of the links that do exist between parents and children, said study co-author Dr. Stephanie Gudde.\n\nResearch has also shown that children without siblings typically score the highest in academics.\n\n\"We are at a point now that we know that the quality of a child's relationship with a mother or a father also plays an important role in its educational outcomes,\" Gudde told The Hill.\n\nAs for the effect of siblings on parents, researchers have known that this phenomenon occurs when dads are away in military service, they are away in high school and are unemployed.\n\nO'Connell said that these findings are different from other studies that suggest parents and their children are more similar than opposite when it comes to IQ.\n\n\"This research, as far as we know, shows that mother's IQ are higher so it's not the case that parents with lower IQ are more similar to their offspring in terms of their cognition,\" O\u2019Connell said. \"There are some differences between children and parents", "label": 1, "id": 100659}
{"text": "John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point out that the \"probability model\" of quantum mechanics that we all learned in high school is actually only a probabilistic account of probability\u2014that a single probability distribution for the entire universe can provide an accurate description of any world event when that probability distribution is consistent with the observed events.\n\nIt is possible to make a quantitative, coherent, and probabilistic statement of the notion that nature has \"a kind of beauty\" (or, as more recently, \"intrigues\") that we can discover experimentally. We call it \"intrigence,\" or more recently, \"intelligent design\" (see below to determine for yourself my definition of \"intelligent\"). But the reality is something very different. Nature does not have a single, consistent, coherent, and even intelligible model that we are capable of ever producing.\n\nThe fact is, nature is full of contradictory information. Information can be described by probability distributions, but each of these distributions is also an inference. There is no one simple model that is consistent with all the observations that we have made. Nature does not have an ontological \"mind\"; she does not have a single and consistent, coherent \"model\" that is capable of encompassing all observation and every possible future observation.\n\nIn light of this very real truth, it is also true to say that nature is not, in principle, intelligible. We are able to create models that are consistent and coherent and are based on scientific knowledge, but it is only natural for all of these models be different from nature itself. We have, however, developed a very practical and effective means of making such models, of representing nature mathematically in a simple and coherent fashion. We call this representation a \"quantum computer,\" as we have created such a model of nature in a very short period of time and have been able to apply it to problems that were not predictable, where previously we couldn't even dream of addressing them \"with our computers.\"\n\nIn this book the term \"intelligent design\" refers to a theory that I was very confident of and believed since the late 1970s until the mid-1980s (in the form of the belief in intelligent superstring theory), but is actually a concept that has no scientific validity. I can write about an Intelligent Design model, but I will not be able to defend it as it does not conform to reality. We have been presented with mathematical representations of the universe that would make the discovery of the laws of nature \"intelligible\"\u2014that is: make sense of our observations.\n\nThere are three key points in this theory that need to be addressed:\n\n  * the definition of \"design\";\n  * the definition of \"intellect\" (or even of \"intelligencing\"); and\n  * the evidence for or against such statements of fact.\n\nFor the scientific community, the only valid meaning of \"design is as we define it today, in terms of a \"purpose or need,\" or something along the lines of \"purpose or need\" in natural law,\" which is a statement of fact. Scientists and the people who do research have no interest in any theory of intelligent design (though they may have an interest in the definition of the terms used in my statements), but they do have an interest in the truth, the reasonableness, and the validity of my statements.\n\n  * The definition and validity of the idea of an \"intelligent designer,\" as discussed in this book (see Chapter 5) are subject to debate.\n\nEven though much has been written on intelligent design, the debate is far from over and even after some significant shifts in public sentiment have occurred, the \"debate\" about intelligent design continues. We can see how this debate has become far more polarized with the publication on February 4 of the National Public Radio's show _Talk of the Nation_ entitled \"Intelligent Design: What Is It and Where's the Evidence?\"\n\nThe book can be downloaded freely from the CEPR website on the webpage \"The Science Behind Intelligent Design.\" The CEPR website also contains links to other intelligent design sites on the Internet and it is possible to download the entire collection of materials from one of the website links and search through the many files there that describe and support the theory of life's development and of the origin of life, including information on the origin of the three major branches of genetic information.\n\n  * There are two arguments that I am interested in regarding the question of intelligent design:\n\nThe first is the argument that scientists tend to make. Scientists tend to be arrogant, to claim a monopoly on knowledge and on truth, which have all the appearance of being established facts. Some science skeptics are not scientific skeptics, they are religious and religious skeptics, but they believe in \"intelligent design\" as a religious belief system. As a \"skeptic,\" I am comfortable with their religion and do not want to get into it here. Some", "label": 1, "id": 100660}

Patrick Wright ( see \"Bibliography\" below )\n\nthe wardens\n\nFor many years, the wizards and the wards were a single and unified political entity. From the earliest days of the wizarding world to the mid-twentieth century, before the rise of the modern government in England and the United States, their political identity was that of one unified and powerful organization of wizards. This is a story about how the guardians, the most senior of the magical communities, gradually took themselves out of that identity to embrace the identity of a social class, a society and a nation, to become a new entity, a new type of organization of wizards. It is a story about how they achieved this.\n\nThis is a big story. This is a narrative in which people who have done a lot of individual research and writing, some for more than a century, take the story back and present it in a way that makes the whole story, by the time you read it, make sense to you.\n\nCharles K. Patrick Wright\n\nCharles K. Patrick Wright (1919\u20131995) was a journalist, writer, poet, and critic. He was the author of two science fiction novels, an opera, and several poetry collections. In 1953 he became director of the University of Southern Mississippi Press, where he established the university's first program in science fiction writing. He received the Pulitzer Prize for the Science Fiction or Fantasy Writing Program, and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 1986. Patrick Wright is survived by his wife Catherine of over sixty years.\n\nThe \"W\"\n\nWe are, of course, the wizards.\n\n\u2014Harry Houdini, quoted in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography\n\nWizarding World\n\nThe history of the wizarding world is closely tied up with the history of the wizards. In the wizarding world, the wizards have always been a distinct and separate class of magic-users\u2014a powerful and respected and unique order of magical individuals. Their history started many hundreds of years before the Wizards' Congress, with the development of the first wizards. This began with the creation of a powerful group of people who performed magic for personal reasons\u2014some in the search for personal or religious enlightenment, some in competition\u2014and who came to be known as \u201cwizards\u201d. As time passed, magic grew in scale and power until, by the middle of the eighteenth century, there was a \u201csophisticated\u201d (by modern standards, anyway) magic community that was so powerful that it was able to challenge the dominance of the church, and to make its own forms of law and set of values that formed the base for some of the laws of magic which are still in effect today. In the nineteenth century there was an increase in magical power until, by the First World War, the magic of the wizards was so great that it was able to challenge the magic of the wizards in the world during World War 1, and the wizarding world became divided between a victorious army which had created and controlled all the magic in the world, which, as a result, was not able to function for long before all magic became useless, and a losing one. At the same time, there was a large and growing population of wizards within the United Kingdom who were not part of the winning side of this war. There seemed to be so little chance of success that a growing number of wizards started secretly forming an alliance and started fighting (but losing) war on the side of the United Kingdom. The war brought about a great split between the wizarding world as a whole. The wizards lost control of all the magic in the world (although, of course, not all the British wizards lost control at the same time). The wizards within the United Kingdom, for their part, gained the ability to create or destroy magic with their mere will or by some other means.\n\nThe wizards of the United Kingdom, being divided by the war and their own history of defeat and defeat, had a difficult time fighting a war for very long against the world magic\u2014not against the wizarding world, against most of the magic, which was a divided group. With the war going on, there was a need (at least before World War 2) to keep all magic in one place and to keep all power in one place. The United Kingdom managed to achieve this without war, even though the battle of the World War 2 brought more wizards on both sides of the war into the world magic. This war brought with it an end to the practice of the ancient practice of wizard control over magic\u2014wizards using their will at the cost of magic being used for the benefit of their world, instead", "label": 1, "id": 100662}

The short features plenty of Betty White and George Clooney banter! It would be a pretty great family film to watch with the kids! Betty White and George Clooney appear in a series of animated shorts called \"Pee Pants & Puppy Love\" (about 2:52 min and 19k). Betty appears in many more Pee Pants & Puppy Love animated shorts, which I have not found information on on YouTube.\n\nIt features Betty and George Clooney and their little dog named \"Puppy Love\".\n\nYou have three options:\n\n1.

These premium packages are offered by the manufacturer under the auspices of the manufacturer. The DVDs are usually packaged in packages. DVD-R are different and they have their own package.\n\nJust looking at this picture makes me want to watch this. The dog looks as if he has a big heart!\n\nI just saw the movie in 3D and it was awesome! There are some really great characters in this movie, Betty is one of them, but I also found George Clooney to be one of the more interesting characters. George doesn't have a normal life, his wife is having an affair with a business man, so he gets to a lot about his life from her side. He's not a very happy person, but he doesn't act all happy, like Tom Cruise in Indiana Jones! I don't think this will work for everyone, I liked it, but it isn't going to work with everyone. I would give it two thumbs up. And you can always check out the YouTube Channel - GeorgeClooney - where he talks about many of the aspects of his life. Check it out!\n\nGreat little animated comedy. Betty White and George Clooney play a big brother to a brother but are actually the opposite of each other. I liked the humor and it kept my attention. In my opinion, it was a bit too early in their career for them to be so comedic. The only downside to this film is that it was the only cartoon I haven't seen so far this year. I'm looking forward to seeing more of these little animated films that are available now in HD.\n\nThe film only ran for 22 minutes or so, but that was enough time to have me interested enough to watch some more. This is more of a silly animated comedy than anything else but it didn't make me laugh out loud either. I would say most people will be into this for the first 20 minutes or so and then get bored. I watched it again to try to rekindle my interest. I don't know if that helps.\n\nI really liked this movie, but it ran long. I had to get it on dvd. I was expecting a shorter movie. I thought it would have been okay if it did the full 22 minutes and it would get you to the end so you could say the ending and get on with \"the next chapter\" - and I'm not that far into the movie yet, I have to find out more. - Thanks, Paul.\n\nThanks for these great reviews! I've never heard of this film before. I'm interested to see what the movie is like", "label": 1, "id": 100665}
{"text": "Their seven-wicket victory in the third Test gave England an invaluable three-day period to recover from last week\u2019s disappointment and rekindle their winning confidence. They needed at least that to set them up for the final Test of the series.\n\nThe new-ball bowlers in their fourth innings were not especially good, although there was a fair bit of quality in the attack as a whole. The England batsmen struggled at first but began to play a much more attacking style this morning.\n\nFirst, there was Peter Siddle\u2019s two wickets, then Ben Foakes took three wickets for just four runs \u2013 two of them stumpings \u2013 and now they needed to get them off their bowling figures for four or five runs. \u2018I was really trying,\u2019 admitted an exuberant Siddle, who has won the toss for England in all three Tests in this series, \u2018but I was probably out to myself. I tried as hard as I could but it just wasn\u2019t quite going my way, especially with the wicket. I can\u2019t explain it. I tried to be aggressive and I probably wasn\u2019t looking for the wicket and tried to push, but it just wasn\u2019t coming off.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am delighted,\u2019 added Siddle, whose recent form suggests he could be used more often at the top of a batting order after making his top Test score this morning. \u2018I think some of the wickets I have been given, they weren\u2019t particularly challenging so it was good to take wickets. It was a good pitch, it gave you bounce, I think it is a good pitch. I am delighted that I still had the ability today to get bat on ball and get wicket at eight overs.\u2019\n\nSo, with his second-innings figures for England in the game he has just bowled five balls, Siddle was also pleased with the way Ben Foakes played in his first spell. \u2018In the first over I tried to play a lot more and when I got in, I found a big gap there for Ben to drive. He did alright, I thought he did alright, he bowled really well. He has not disappointed, but I think he has given himself more opportunities to bat, as he can bat a little quicker. You know, he\u2019s an older age lad and you always want him to come out, the last time against Australia, he came out of the game after seven, eight overs and you could see the ball coming in from him.\u2019 He has also found the ball going into the on-side, although he concedes this is just a small thing that could become regularity.\n\n\u2018You know, Australia had a number three bowler there who bowled very often and did a lot of line and length, he was pretty good. He used to bowl a lot at me and I have always tried to bowl to him and tried to do the same to him. I would have used a different approach today if I was batting first. Unfortunately because the ball was really going round, it was pretty difficult.\n\n\u2018It was still pretty good. It was better, I had to bowl four balls. I bowled four balls and England\u2019s wicketkeeper got us out for six. I put a length of ball in every ball. If I put a short, mid-on [length] in, then he could hit it to cover, that\u2019s what I did. It was the wrong length and that was going into the on-side and we had our wickets, I could see that.\n\n\u2018The wicket\u2019s nice and firm, it gives you a little bit of bounce, but you know, if you bowl a full length ball down that\u2019s a really good catch by the keeper, you do lose wicket if you bowl this full length on it. He is not particularly strong there, so he was coming down and he took two catches as well. He\u2019s a pretty good keeper but he can take them too. I have learnt from him over the years.\u2019\n\nSiddle had made 23, Foakes seven in his first spell to take the game to lunch. England have struggled with the ball in the first innings, with the most notable performance of note being the second-innings dismissal of England\u2019s debut-captain Alastair Cook for 31, his second first-wicket score in his second innings in the game in Adelaide in his Test debut in 2005. In this match, however, he did nothing wrong and bowled solidly as he moved his left-handers into play. This morning, he did the same again.\n\nIt is a measure of England\u2019s strength and ability as a unit and also a measure of Siddle\u2019s bowling ability that England\ufffd", "label": 1, "id": 100666}

And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged that Trump sought a delay on the health care bill so he could ram through a bill without a Democratic support.\n\nTrump could then be asked to sign a law to waive the Constitution\u2019s so-called Speech or Debate Clause requiring the president to give up his own salary during an impeachment trial or impeachment proceeding, but it seems less likely that he will do so. In addition, with the Senate on a lengthy recess and expected to vote on health care later Tuesday, the White House could go to court seeking to block Schumer\u2019s motion calling for the rules to be changed.\n\nThe Senate is expected to begin a two week recess Tuesday with only three days between Senate sessions. Trump had declared the House would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and the Senate a \u201ctotal and complete disaster\u201d for the country while at the same time asking senators to vote.\n\nIn the House, Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, after multiple witnesses testified over two weeks of testimony in the Senate, including the testimony of White House staff. The testimony of former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also added to the pressure on Trump, after the president publicly told McCabe at a White House meeting last year that he could have him fired if he did not \u201ccome up with dirt\u201d on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that senior White House and Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and White House Counsel Don McGahn, instructed McGahn to fire McCabe after consulting with the DOJ\u2019s \u201cOffice of Professional Responsibility,\u201d citing their concern about \u201ca politically motivated termination.\u201d\n\nTrump had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into Carter Page, a Democratic National Committee political donor, when he learned that Page had met with Trump\u2019s campaign officials, according to the report.\n\nMcCabe wrote in his memos that the incident \u201cexhibited a clear lack of judgment and put integrity rules and standards above loyalty to country.\u201d\n\nThe Hill reported Tuesday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly privately complained to Trump that he and other top aides weren't being fired, or at least not as severely as he felt. But when it became clear that the Justice Department wasn't about to dismiss McCabe, Kelly reportedly told Trump that the \u201cnext time I see you I want you to thank me.\u201d\n\nThat was an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s reported belief, even as a candidate and during the presidential campaign, that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 election because she was a \u201cweak\u201d candidate.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing, however, didn\u2019t seem to cause Trump\u2019s White House staffers much concern, as they continued implementing his directives, as well as sending out other letters to Comey and others within Comey\u2019s leadership, telling them not to comment on the Comey firing when that would put him in danger.\n\nAfter the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and outside legal analysts pointed to McCabe for firing Comey to get a special counsel appointed, Comey wrote a letter outlining his concerns and noting that he had never considered firing Comey.\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, \u201cMcCabe, Trump officials and Comey all agree that the only explanation for his firing is that Comey told the truth when he said he was investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia in connection with the Trump Tower meeting \u2014 evidence the White House didn\u2019t want to see leaked publicly.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "label": 1, "id": 100667}

Lee and General Stonewall Jackson, is one of Jacksonville's most impressive remaining examples of Spanish colonial architecture and one of Europe's finest man-made islands. A historic home for families, Capecitos has seen an explosion of creative, award-winning private events, making this an ideal location for private weddings and corporate events.\n\nThe Jacksonville Pier, first opened in 1930, is a 1.5-mile-long pier that stretches across the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean. Today, the Jacksonville International Airport is located adjacent to the pier, and two of the three historic ferries connecting to Jacksonville go directly from the airport to the Pier. The Jacksonville Maritime Museum, located within walking distance of the pier, contains an excellent collection of maritime artifacts, paintings, photographs, paintings, artifacts, ship models, memorabilia, documents, and more.\n\nThe Southland shopping center consists of three distinct sections. The centerpiece is its signature two-level arcade, featuring boutiques, local restaurants, as well as a hotel and two other restaurants. The Southland is one of Jacksonville's most upscale shopping facilities, and it contains four- and five\u00ad stories of high-end name brand stores that offer shoppers an experience designed to be one of the most exciting in the area.\n\nLocated on the banks of Orange Avenue, near the intersection of Jacksonville Beach Boulevard, this charming, private residential neighborhood has long been a home to a large African-American population and an array of churches and other unique private residences. Today, the community has undergone a period of significant redevelopment with the addition of a second hotel and the unveiling of a new, modern, and state-of-the-art mall (and the revitalization of the historic St. Johns Town Square housing development)\u2014both within a short distance of Orange Avenue.\n\nHome to the first large community college in Florida, Jacksonville State University offers a wide variety of programs, the largest of which are located here. The university also boasts a history of excellent faculty, with many former members of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marines teaching a wide variety of subjects here.\n\nJacksonville has grown explosively in the last decade, and its downtown area has become the most vibrant of the metropolitan areas in South Florida. This central business district offers the finest shops, restaurants, and entertainment, most notably at the newly constructed Jacksonville Landing. The city of Jacksonville has also emerged as one of the fastest growing cities in the country (its population has doubled since 2000) and enjoys a vibrant cultural life as well as numerous outstanding educational opportunities, including the University of North Florida, St. Thomas University, and Jacksonville State University.\n\nThis postcard of a Jacksonville beach scene clearly shows the historic mansions perched on sandhills on Jek'let Island (the northernmost island in the chain). The sandhills were originally cultivated by the Phoenicians. The first English colonists to settle the area were the Spaniards, who soon named the bay \"Jalape\u00f1o\" (\"island of the pepper bushes\"). As a result, the island was named for a bay in the province of the same name on the Spanish mainland. In 1638, King Charles I of England ordered all English settlement in South Florida to be destroyed, ending the region's British colonial history. The area was taken back from the Spanish by the Jesuits and became part of the French Province of La Nouvelle-France in 1762 and then the Spanish Empire when Spain became a republic in 1776.\n\nIn 1770, a ship carrying 300 British Royal Marines landed and soon a small fort was constructed. In 1855 the fort was enlarged and converted into a navy shipyard. In 1911 Jacksonville's shipbuilding industry started to grow rapidly. Jacksonville became first a shipping port, and later Jacksonville evolved into a second world city. After the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a major producer of ships. The shipyard became the Navy's premier shipbuilding center. Jacksonville was founded on a swamp. Its history was shaped by sea battles, wars, and earthquakes. As the city grew in population, much of Jacksonville's original residential area was developed. For more than three decades, Jacksonville's population grew at a rate much faster than that in most of the country. In the 1920s and early thirties, Jacksonville was designated the most beautiful city in America, and it remained so until the mid-1960s, when the hurricane of 1964 caused serious damage to the city's infrastructure and forced a large-scale realignment of the city's layout. The city continued to enjoy record growth during the next 35 years. It became a national", "label": 1, "id": 100669}

In this instance i\u2019ll be mentioning it as it relates to Dark Souls I know it\u2019s not the best series out there by a long shot just yet, but i\u2019ll make it a point to discuss as much of the game as could be in this one.\n\nNow Dark Souls is in stores now for both PS3 and 360, the game came out last year May of 2008, and with such success from the game and its creators, it is still a topic of debate as to when the series is a good or bad series and what would be the best way to pick this title over other ones out on the market as of today (June).\n\nDark Soul\nGame: Souls\nDeveloper: From Software\n\nWhat\u2019s so special that we should all take notice on Dark Souls, since i\u2019m not going to spoil it for you, let\u2019s just say it is truly a special game when you get into it.\n\nFrom Software has been making games and they really had something new to offer with an RPG with many open-world exploration and character development that the series was never before put out and with gameplay that is a blast to play through.\n\nWe have to talk a lot in regards to the story and how from Software have created such a deep and amazing storyline that i\u2019d really like to go into it and elaborate on it as much as possible, but that would take a little far for this review.\n\nNow when you pick up the game, you are on a dark world where the gods and demons reside and you must go through many stages along the way to gain the items and tools necessary to fight and defeat these evil spirits or as we call them \u201cdemons\u201d. Many of the demons you fight are quite large and have huge bodies, so you have to learn and practice to be able to fight them without getting overpowered since it is part of the story to learn of course.\n\nAlong the way through the game you have to learn of course and gain the tools to get out of the demons\u2019 way and gain power in order to protect and guard yourself from the demons that reside on this harsh and dark world. Along the way you find loot to use as currency and more, but also need to fight some bosses that are large enough to need to use it as ammunition, and if you do hit one it is pretty hard to stop since it will almost instantly knock you out.\n\nThe weapons are also fairly huge and look impressive in their appearance and size.\n\nAs of now i\u2019ve not yet played as many games as many people have, but the things that i\u2019ve seen that others have noted, that seems to be the case many times are the size of enemies, like demons, or like in Dark Souls they are large and have huge bodies so they don\u2019t seem to just disappear when you hit them but instead move around and hit you, and when you do hit one you\u2019re almost instantly knocked out since they are fast moving and you can\u2019t get out in time. This also shows how slow the animations are, but we\u2019ll talk about that in a later review.\n\nThe animations while you are playing the game are very funny to watch, they are very slow, and the characters seem very human and sometimes even animated, it was something that i think was necessary for the game to be enjoyable and a good amount of fun to play, i\u2019ve heard some things that it is some times a bit clunky from being in this fast paced action game and i\u2019m sure that i\u2019m wrong about that since many people may find it really enjoyable and a lot of fun, but i\u2019ll still keep things in mind for future use.\n\nNow along back to the story. The story in Dark Souls takes place in the very same world that we are still in at this time, but now we see it from many different angles and perspectives. The opening sequence is that of the main story as you are the only survivor of a small village and see it in the way that you have seen it at a time many years ago.\n\nOnce you get out of this town, you get a new life and new memories, you travel to another village that you find is in the exact same situation, until you meet a group of young teens who seem to remember the same thing as you and have a completely different life going on in comparison to you, which you quickly discover that you are the same person who started with this group and they may have even grown up in another village, and it is then that you get into a bit of a fight with them, one", "label": 1, "id": 100670}

It hosts Boeing 737s (with about 1,100 a year), and new 737s have a long shelf-life: in 2017, the plane that delivered a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the factory in Everett, Washington, was still flying seven years later.\n\nThe airport\u2019s location in the L.A./Orange county corridor has made it a magnet for commercial aircraft from around the globe. While passenger traffic was rising in the last part of the 20th century, it was not the same as it once was because of a shift in where the world\u2019s biggest economies were based: East Asia.\n\nThere are few cities on earth where air traffic has grown more dramatically over the past 50 years than in and around LAX.

{"text": "been funded in part at least by cuts to tax credits for low- and middle-income families.\n\nAs the new figures indicate, the deficit is being driven upwards in the United States - even as the United Kingdom attempts desperately to put its finances in order.\n\nThe UK still has huge problems to sort out. The Coalition government has given a massive blank cheque to a private sector that needs strong oversight and government to deal with the debt crisis - and they are only going to dig themselves in deeper for the sake of the present government and its supporters in the media.\n\nFor as David Cameron pointed out, even now our deficits are falling because borrowing to repair our banks will eventually be offset by public spending cuts. The government insists that it has \"a plan to balance the budget by 2018-19\" though that statement is being challenged by the likes of George Osborne.\n\nDespite a record \u00a312.4 billion in spending cuts the Bank of England announced last week, David Cameron promised this week that it is being used to plug holes in the deficit budget - the main reason public services have been slashed in recent years.\n\nHowever, the numbers in the UK Treasury are being used to justify government budget cuts, as the UK government continues to ignore the fact that while we may have the financial strength of the world's second largest economy there are several problems that will need more attention than fiscal rectitude. A large swathe of the economy is suffering from a combination of stagnant pay, a jobless rate of just over 8 per cent, a falling unemployment rate, and house prices where \u00a31,000,000 is not even worth a lot less than the \u00a3500,00 we paid for our home in the 1990s.\n\nThe government is also continuing to fiddle with tax credits on the taxpayer's behalf for the benefits that have gone into the hands of a small- and medium-sized company run by a small number of middle men, with the result that the Treasury is left with a large deficit from which it will be difficult to recover under the spending cuts introduced so far.\n\nThe UK government has been heavily criticised for the role that private firms are using credit and government loans to make investment decisions as an alternative to their employees - even though there is evidence the profits made by the big public sector lenders have dropped by billions for the first time in a decade as borrowing at banks went up as a share of the economy.\n\nAs George Osborne said today, the Conservative party has been \"working throughout the government to ensure we don't get into a situation where an emergency loan bill keeps growing for years to come.\n\n\"We understand that this is extremely difficult, and it doesn't mean we can't take responsibility for our debts by setting the right priorities.\"\n\nBut the government's response to the mounting threat of a Greek exit from the Euro has been to slash tax credits for lower-earning families on the pretext that we need to avoid \"a massive Greek default\" and to reduce other welfare in order to reduce welfare spending.\n\nIt's an old trick from the left and the right to try and blame austerity on the poor, but the truth is that while austerity makes them angry they are not the ones to suffer the consequences. They will continue to receive a big pay-back as those who have been given handouts by the state can make the most of the new money. But most of the population will suffer because the private sector in Britain will get just one big pay-off from the new growth while the government's deficit will go up, further straining the public budgets of the working class.\n\nIt also goes without saying that they in the media are happy to blame any misfortune they see upon the state, because they can then blame it on the Tories as well and hope for a bigger share of the profits of privatisation. However what is important to remember is that the privatisation of the last government has been nothing to show but good results, with the privatisation of the banking sector in particular providing a return on investment of \u00a3120 billion.\n\nThe government will no doubt blame the government's own deficit on their cuts, but they will not go so far as to say that they are reducing the deficit - even with the cuts being rolled out for the rest of the country by government departments in a last-gasp attempt to save the rest of the public sector budgets. What the British ruling class cannot tolerate is another payback for the cuts. They also fear a class war being instigated by the working class that they cannot control - they are the ones to benefit from class war.", "label": 1, "id": 100674}

The world has seen some rough times, but what is happening now, is anything but the \u2018bad guys\u2019. They are simply your neighbours, and your co-workers; some you have had for decades, others in less than a day. You are at the forefront of the changes, but you have no idea what is to come.\n\nIf you do, you will find that what you\u2019ve imagined is nothing more of what is to come.\n\nIf you are at the forefront of the changes, you can change the world. The future will never look the same in your face. It will never be you.\n\nThis book is for you, that dreamer. It is so simple, so you can use it to help make the world a better place \u2013 for those around you; and to leave you with an amazing story!\n\nMy name is Matt Stone and I\u2019m the main character of a book.\n\nThis is called \u2018Gemworld\u2019 and written by me, Matt Stone.\n\nWe both had a few lives, before, we met. I was a writer, and he was a gamer. My life was more interesting than his, and it all changed when I became his friend. I started off as his main character\u2019s greatest secret: That he was an alien from outer space. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, we never discussed that part of who I was, but I took a little bit of my character into his and said, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m an alien from outer space too\u201d. Even though, it wasn\u2019t something I even thought about. We were just two friends who played videogames.\n\nIf you had asked me then, what I thought he was, I would have called him \u201ca bit strange\u201d. I didn\u2019t like the term strange \u2013 it gave me a weird feeling. I would have said that I think people usually think strange, but I didn\u2019t like the weird \u2013 it gave me a weird feeling. In order to explain my weirdness, Matt was, at first, only a game character. Then, we started to spend more time, and we became friends. I liked him because he was an alien. He wasn\u2019t a human character. But then, something weird started to happened. We went from being just friends to being friends, to being more than friends. We started to look after each other \u2013 our friendship turned into something more.\n\nAll of this started to happen when we realised that I was an alien. This wasn\u2019t something that was ever mentioned by Matt \u2013 but, it soon became obvious to me, that was my most defining characteristic. How do alien cultures look and behave? Their culture \u2013 even with aliens \u2013 doesn\u2019t necessarily look like ours \u2013 how do they behave? What does our culture look and behave like? I felt that the answer to these questions would help me as a character. And, this is when the whole thing began to", "label": 1, "id": 100676}

When it comes to the movie, you've got to see it for yourself.\n\n\nThe film centers on the young girl (Aly Michalka) who is staying with her father, a reclusive, creepy, old man (Christopher Walken) who lives in an old mansion with a wife and two other ghosts. The mansion is not haunted, but the ghost of the old man (Nathan Lane) isn't happy about this. There are other things out there, though.\n\nThere have only been two other movies with a similar theme, and one of them was made by a guy whose name I never bothered to figure out. What is it with haunted mansions? What is it like to live in them? Who are the people who live in them? What do they wear? What is it like when the house is on fire?\n\nThere it is in a nutshell: the horror movie, and the old adage that it's easier than you think to predict how a movie is going to end, as a rule.", "label": 1, "id": 100677}
{"text": "I absolutely love this film. Everything about it. It almost made me cry, even though at the same time I'm angry. I'm so angry I can barely think. I feel like I can talk for hours, but nothing works. Even the subtitles are difficult to understand.\n\nThis was a movie I've wanted to see since I was a little kid and I finally got my chance. I didn't make it home to see it yet because there was this awful storm raging outside, and the streets were dangerous, so I spent the night watching movies on the screen.\n\nI've been wanting one for over 10 years, and I finally picked up my copy for Christmas from Amazon and I absolutely can not WAIT to play it. I'll probably be getting it in about two weeks I think in like a month and the only thing that's bugging me is I really want to make a copy of the last 30 minutes or so or the beginning to watch with my wife. I've seen it like 2-3 times, usually it's like the whole thing and I get bored really quickly (not this time).\n\nI remember it had the new movie poster on it. I didn't see it until a few hours earlier. I was going to go out when my wife and I were going out to dinner that night, and I was in the middle of buying another gift when we got home. I was watching my Amazon purchase and saw it. I wasn't planning on trying it out tonight, but I just couldn't pass it up. I love all the songs, and it really is a great movie. We had a great time and it was very different from anything I've seen. I really recommend it.\n\nMy daughter found this movie on a list of \"new\" things she wanted to see. It was new at the time, and she wanted to give it a try. I'd like to try it, but really do think it's at the top of things I have to see.\n\nIt was so sweet and funny that I completely forgot to even put the remote on when it came on.\n\nSo excited to see how this one goes! I really really want to see it, especially when the last scene shows her saying \"I love you, Daddy\" to Dad and him getting really angry at her for something so silly.\n\nI really want to see how this one ends. I feel like it's gonna end really great.\n\nAnd, to be perfectly honest, I really really want to see how this one ends. I love how it ends: she gets knocked up by a guy. I love her so much. But I don't want to see it end. I just know. And also, the ending was so funny! There's so many crazy things that could happen and they don't because \"the little girl\" wants to have her cake and eat it too. :P\n\nThe soundtrack was awesome. When you start to recognize certain songs, you listen to them a few more times before just hearing them over and over and over again. Especially with the new album 'Uncle Kracker'.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to put this out there:\n\nThe \"making out\" scene was hot. I remember when I was 14 and my friend and I were making out when my friend mentioned that she really wanted to do this and I didn't think she could be serious. But, it was just her. We watched a movie that was supposed to be pretty heavy (because it had an older sister), but I found myself in a different room the whole time. It made me really sad that we had to watch that stupid movie, but we did anyways. It was just cute and sweet.\n\nIt's all about that love. The love for the child, the love for the mother, the love for her husband.\n\nI also really really want to see how her mother behaves at the end because it makes me so sad that we have to leave this movie. :S\n\nI have high expectations because this was the first I've seen the film myself and I'm not usually one for a huge spoiler or anything.\n\nBUT. It did make my stomach flip, it did make my heart race and it did make my voice go up a few octaves.\n\nIt just made my blood boil at times, if you know what I mean. You should see it, because you wouldn't forget things like that. And I wouldn't forget about it because it made me feel really happy at times. :D\n\nIt's not sad at all.. I was actually in shock when I saw that she got pregnant, and then I fell madly in love with her, and this whole movie did something to me. But in a good way. It made me love her more. So.

The result of the approach, which we call the discrete time-dependent discrete Ginzburg-Landau method, provides a natural generalization of the well-known Landau theory, which was introduced in the early 1940s (see for example, D.\u00a0Porretti, R.\u00a0Budrene, and W.\u00a0Peschek, J.

{"text": "DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about greed and corruption\u2014just brutal enough to be a movie, and bloody enough to have a good plot; you\u2019re going to have to see it the movie first. Its protagonist, Philippe, runs his father\u2019s company, and soon has his sights set on the biggest company in the world: Nestl\u00e9. His father (Pascal Greggory) gives him a choice: he can marry his current love, the beautiful and rich Nathalie (Monique Duparcot), or go into partnership with Nestl\u00e9 and become the CEO of the company. That\u2019s enough of the setup. It\u2019s the business, stupid. Philippe is an ambitious bastard, and to be honest, the thing he wants most in life is money. So what if it kills him?\n\nAfter running Nestl\u00e9 for three years to become its CEO, Philippe\u2019s plans change when he takes a call from a mysterious man named Monsieur Dreyfus (Michel Serrault), who tells him he is to receive an offer from a secret account of Nestl\u00e9. In that account is a $100 million investment from a man named Guillaume, who needs Philippe to find a mysterious piece of metal with a code which no one can figure out, and which will make him more than a million dollars, maybe more. Philippe doesn\u2019t believe him, but agrees to see the guy. He agrees to meet up, but not with Dreyfus: Dreyfus and his team are already gone; they have been replaced by two young guys hired by Philippe.\n\nBut as Philippe is taken to meet his old mentor, the one who fired him for taking the company into an investment, he discovers Nestl\u00e9 is owned by his father, who has hidden away $800,000 in an account of funds to pay for the building of a new distribution center for Nestl\u00e9. Philippe tells his father he believes his company is a better idea, and he will stay with the company and run it for his father as well. The company is bought for $1,200 a share, $100 million. It\u2019s just the beginning for Philippe. After the acquisition, Dreyfus sends his young men to the building site, where he orders all the workers to dig up the money from the company\u2019s building and burn it.\n\nPhilippe and his father then meet with a lawyer to arrange for a transfer of funds from the account at the center for the company; the money is given to a company clerk working for Philippe that day. Philippe is to stay there and serve his father as CEO and make the money, and once that has been done, the company\u2019s shares will be put up for sale. The board members will have a new buyer, all the assets will be sold, and the money will disappear with Dreyfus.\n\nHe is a monster, that Dreyfus.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple setup, with plenty of plot twists and plenty of action: it has been known for movies and TV to end badly, with an unsatisfied audience. But even the most simple of plot setups has its flaws, and this one has plenty of them. The entire story is just about Philippe vs. Dreyfus with only a hint of who the other man is. It is well acted\u2014but not enough\u2014it just isn\u2019t compelling enough to make you care. In fact, I left the theater thinking: why bother?\n\nThere is another plot twist left in, which is only hinted at but which can be guessed only by the audience. The last quarter of the film is just about money, and its the one where you will get the most. And yes, that is the thing that has been holding this movie back: if it didn\u2019t have that, it might have been better. It is this money thing that makes this movie the more compelling and exciting, in my opinion. It makes it the more effective. This is why I left the theater thinking \u201cWhy bother?\u201d\n\nThe movie is directed by Julien Londres and written by Jean-Marie Larqu\u00e9.

{"text": "background : timely access to cardiovascular health services is necessary. Further steps to overcome this barrier included addressing a lack of awareness of the CVD risk score by promoting its use and its importance. This might have occurred through mass media (publicly, through the internet, and so on), mass education campaigns, or by training health professionals or the public on the CVD risk profile. Inclusion of a CVD risk score in the patient\\'s first cardiology encounter may have been the means to achieve this. At present, our data did not enable us to quantify the proportions of patients or practitioners who are aware of CVD risk and have the correct patient record, which is the first step in reducing this barrier.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the data collection introduced recall bias, as the data were collected only from records in this institution. However, this might have had a limited effect on our study findings, as we used a data collection template that was specifically designed to collect the type and number of CVD risk assessment tests performed over the study period. The patients\\' records had been reviewed routinely with the review of the template\\'s audit tool and audit tool\\'s checks to ensure data completeness and consistency. Second, our analyses involved only 10 hospitals. This allowed us to analyse data from across a wide range of hospitals in England, including large and small community hospitals and teaching hospital sites; however, it is possible that the findings are not generalisable to hospitals outside these. Third, there is no 'Gold Standard' system for CVD risk assessment, which is the cornerstone of establishing the CVD risk category from which the CVD risk score was calculated in this study. The choice of our benchmark was made a priori, based on the evidence based guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology to determine the CVD risk-assessed heart failure (HF) risk category,^[@R26]^ and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) CVD risk score tool for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.^[@R27]^ These systems are based on using the Framingham criteria (age, gender, smoking) in combination with risk factors,^[@R27][@R28]^ except for those who are over age 75 and those with diabetes mellitus (see [online supplementary table III](#SP1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} for details, available at [online supplementary table 5](#SP1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). However, both systems have some limitations, including the potential for patients classified as having higher CVD risk (\u226510%) to have either no CVD risk or high CVD risk (\u226520%) from one risk assessment tool,^[@R27]^ and the potential for the CVD risk score to be overestimated from a single CVD risk assessment done without a repeat evaluation.^[@R29]^\n\n10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011134.supp1\n\n10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011134.supp2\n\nAs we were not able to do population-based analyses to evaluate the validity of the results for these patients, we chose to focus on hospital cohorts with well documented CVD risk profiles. However, as there was no gold standard system for risk classification, any results seen for patients who were wrongly classified could be viewed as potentially problematic.\n\nIn summary, most patients with known cardiovascular risk profile who had an admission for HF in one month had moderate level of CVD risk profile, according to published guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology. Our findings would suggest that most patients were well-educated on the importance of CVD risk factors and that they received some or all of their CVD risk assessments using the Framingham CVD risk score. Our findings emphasise the use of the Framingham CVD risk score for the risk assessment of HF admissions, and highlight the need for improved education around CVD risk assessment for people at risk of CVD.\n\nSupplementary Material\n======================\n\n###### Reviewer comments\n\n###### Author\\'s manuscript\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the contribution of the following: the clinicians involved in the care of patients discharged from one of the centres involved; the ward nurses who performed CVD risk management in the hospital; and the patient and public involvement members from both public and medical professional sectors.

Later that night when Williams went to Edwards' flat, he said he had his own problems to contend with because his 16-year-old daughter was in bed and he could not do anything because the lights were on.

{"text": "Only one of nine expert witnesses approached did not want to comment.\n\nThe other witnesses, also selected by the Justice Department, defended the practice as legally legitimate \u2014 for the most part. The lawyers for the Defense Department, meanwhile, described the process as \u201cfair.\u201d Yet in court interviews all agreed on very few details: namely, that only one of nine expert witnesses was told which witnesses to approach and which to avoid. Even the lawyers for the Justice Department acknowledged that many of the experts, many of them from academic institutions, were not qualified.\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s central premise is that it is possible to manipulate facts in order to get an innocent person to plead guilty. The question is why does the FBI have a hand in that process?\n\nAn examination of the records the Justice Department provided to the Court, along with the information gleaned from dozens of interviews with people involved in the case, as well as interviews with experts and researchers, raises more problems than answers. But some of these answers can at least be gleaned.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s main concern \u2014 that is, the central question in this case \u2014 has to do with two concepts that have been explored by federal, state, and academic experts.\n\nThe first concerns the FBI\u2019s use of the federal guidelines to determine which expert witnesses to approach and which to avoid. The rationale for this policy is that an expert witness \u201cwould know almost by definition whom he would be able to testify favorably on behalf of Mr. [Bryant]. An expert should certainly not be a witness for Mr. [Bryant] or for the defense,\u201d said Michael Wessel, the former FBI agent who prosecuted the case.\n\nIndeed, Wessel said, \u201c[y]ou wouldn\u2019t want to give the guy who\u2019s going to be the prosecution\u2019s expert a chance to cross-examine the guy who\u2019s going to be Mr. [Bryant\u2019s] expert.\u201d\n\nWessel\u2019s logic is that such cross-examinations might reveal that the expert witness on the prosecution\u2019s side of the case has an inherent bias. But the premise is implausible, since the experts who have been selected \u2014 and approved \u2014 have no apparent bias against the defense. In the vast majority of these cases, the expert witness has even defended the prosecution from the outset.\n\nThe second concept under scrutiny is a longstanding FBI practice in which a confidential informant can persuade an individual to commit an act that would help his or her case.\n\nThe tactic has been used in numerous cases throughout history. One example: that of Anna E. Blaszczyk. In 2011, the federal prosecutors working on the case against Anna Blaszczyk, a Polish woman, asked her husband, a former postal worker in Wisconsin, to send their 15-year-old daughter back to Poland, where she feared she would be kidnapped by organized crime. The husband was a witness for the the prosecution at Anna\u2019s trial, and, according to testimony in the case, agreed to help.\n\nHe sent his daughter to a third country. She then mailed her letters \u2014 in English \u2014 to her father, suggesting they had an understanding. She even enclosed an English-language note to his ex-wife. \u201cIt really sounded like she really loved him,\u201d explained Dr. Blaszczyk\u2019s lawyer, Michael Wierzynek. The prosecution, Wierzynek added, \u201cknew they were getting good value for money with this deal, and they were doing it again.\u201d\n\nThe letters, she included, gave evidence of her innocence.\n\nThe strategy proved to be a dead end.\n\nIn 2013, Anna\u2019s husband was indicted \u2014 but convicted of a misdemeanor after an appeal \u2014 for allegedly using his role in his daughter\u2019s scheme to persuade her to mail a letter to her former husband.\n\nAnd although it might be argued that the prosecution had the \u201cright\u201d to try her husband, she now contends: \u201cThe FBI lied \u2026 the FBI did not use their power for the purpose for which they were intended and violated Anna\u2019s equal protection rights.\u201d\n\nThe FBI also says it is not against the law to lie. Indeed, according to Wessel, \u201canybody in their right mind can tell a witness, \u2018You\u2019re not credible,\u2019 and they could go arrest their next victim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sophisticated tool.\u201d\n\nFBI agents who have worked the case said they were shocked by the tactics used to ensnare Anna and her former husband. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie, a total,\u201d said Agent Charles Allen", "label": 1, "id": 100683}
{"text": "we study unlimited infinite churn in peer - to - peer settings with a large number and type of transactions.\n\nThe data that we have from both the academic perspective and the real world is that:\n\n1) Users do not like the idea of always knowing that their money goes nowhere - there is very little motivation to stick with.\n2) That has to change.\n\nThe peer to peer model is the model that will change peoples behaviour.\n\nHere I should make a special note about block reward reductions, as I believe this is what is creating both the incentives and the friction that we are starting to observe.\n\nYou'll notice that the chart above shows two different behaviours. In the top half, one transaction is sent every 1000 blocks. In the bottom half, one transaction is sent every 500 blocks. In the second half-way, one transaction is sent every 1000 blocks. However, in the first half-way, it is more than 1000 times more likely that one transaction is sent, and it is more than 1000 times less likely that one transaction will be received. So, this is also a reduction in block reward.\n\nWe know that the peer to peer model increases the number of transactions and lowers the block reward. The question remains therefore, how much of this increase in 'transaction volume' can be attributed to reduction in block reward?\n\nBy comparison, the increase in transaction volume in Bitcoin is very much reduced compared to Bitcoin Cash.\n\nLet's continue to consider our Bitcoin example. With one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, there are no blocks of any significance for 1000 blocks - there is no benefit of increased transaction volume. With one transaction every 500 blocks - that is, the amount of blocks that have a single transaction is the block size is less, but the amount of transactions that can be processed is significantly above normal - the block reward is significantly reduced- then the increase in the number of transactions and the change in incentive becomes very significant indeed.\n\nOf course we could also say that the block reward should be the market value of the Bitcoin.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, there is no incentive to generate any new transactions and create any'real' value in the system - it simply becomes a 'cost of use' - the block reward reduces to what it was previously.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, block reward is 0 - users just don't have the incentive for creating a lot of transactions- and the transaction market value goes down.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, one transaction costs 0- there is an incentive for one transaction - but no incentive for more.\n\nWhen blocks have 100+ transactions, the block reward is reduced significantly - for an overall increase in transaction volume of 1000x, the block reward is reduced by 1000x.\n\nWhen blocks have 10+ transactions, or even one transaction in each 1000 blocks, the block reward reduction is much less.\n\nWhen blocks have 1 in 1000, 1 in 100, 1 in 15,1 in 3,1 in 5 - the block reward is reduced by 1 in 15=25%,1 in 1000, 1 in 1000, 1 in 1000, 1 in 1000.\n\nWhat you can notice by reducing the block reward by even one per thousand, is the incentive to create the minimum number of transactions. When there is no incentive - then the incentive to send thousands of transactions per day is also zero.\n\nIn effect, even a slight reduction in the block reward is enough to completely remove the incentive for many users - in fact even a 5% reduction in the block reward creates no incentive for creating thousands of transactions.\n\nThis is only going to affect the overall user adoption of the network at the start because of the incentive reduction that we have already discussed above.\n\nPeer nodes and block producers only start out having incentive to produce blocks without peer nodes. They simply start out generating blocks that have zero-one zero-one transactions.\n\nPeer to Peer is a much more complex mechanism than Bitcoin Block Times in general.\n\nIn general, there is no reason an individual block producer would want to slow down the transaction or block time. On the other hand, they do have an incentive to not have as many transactions processed in a block in order to increase the block reward - but how this is going to work depends on the model.\n\nIn theory this could happen as follows:\n\n1) One transaction is broadcast, the block producer looks to see if there are any unread transactions. If it does not find anything, the new block needs to be accepted.\n\nThis is where we are starting to see a reduction in the block reward to zero.\n\n2) Then with one transaction, one block is produced and then the number of unread transactions are checked. If they are 0 or less, accept the block. Otherwise wait for the next block to generate.\n\nOnce again", "label": 1, "id": 100684}

{"text": "I was surprised that \"\" Forgiving the Franklins \"\" did a review of the film at its premiere screening, with its conclusion that the film was \"a real contender to become the next big thing in film\"\" (\"The Hollywood Reporter\"). The same reviewer went on to rave in regards to the film, saying that \"\" Forgiving the Franklins \"\" \"loved this film, and wanted nothing but good things to say about it. And if you do care to know more about what I did do to get a very decent review published in a pretty mainstream press (and to have my name attached to it on the review page!) here's what I did: I actually wrote two reviews that I put forward in the same breath, one under a pseudonym, the one that was printed in the \"The Hollywood Reporter\"...the other under my real name? I really don't understand his reasoning, as I'd hate for my name to be attached to this as well...? However, I had a great time doing this with my kids, and seeing their reactions when these films we love were being covered, I really think this is the best possible way to give the credit and recognition to these films they long for: when they see their name being attached to a piece of work.\n\nThe \"The Hollywood Reporter\" is only one of many reputable publications that have reviewed this film, both in print and online. My friends in and around the \"Hollywood Reporter\" have been very happy to hear that I was a part of this review, and they're happy to put me to work. Here's an excerpt from the \"Hollywood Reporter\" review of the film at its premiere screening, the reviewer says this about the film:\n\nIt's hard to tell if \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is more touching than \"A Christmas Story\" but it's at least a little more than that.\n\nIt's not a traditional musical that's sure to bring a grin to the viewer's face but when we're talking about how to get more children to come see our movies, this is definitely a movie that's worth seeing.\n\nIt's a movie you'll remember long after the lights come on but when the kids ask \"Daddy where were the elves?\" a \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" could be the answer you'll like most.\"\n\nI think this reviewer clearly misjudged the film, which is fine: I don't care too much for the Christmas story as a movie, but it is certainly a worthy follow-up to A Christmas Story. The way I saw it when I reviewed the film at its premiere at the Film Festival, with the \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" review getting published in the \"The Hollywood Reporter\" about its premiere, the movie I am most happy to be able to know is how to get more children to see our movies. And I know that once \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" was out, it would make my job to have more people watching our movie possible.\n\n\"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is definitely one of my favorites from 2012 and hopefully the last one that I will not see, as I still have work to do on one of my favorite films from 2012. But I know it will be hard to watch it out of fear of getting angry at it, as I was almost angry when I heard it was a movie we could find in our children's schools as a teaching tool to be taught when children see it with the rest of the works of the Christmas movie. And I hope many people will finally realize the potential in \"Forgive Me, Franklin\", even if \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is something that only children can love.\n\nAbout a year ago, it was a great feeling to know that I helped bring together a film festival, where one of our favorite movies, our new favorite movie \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" would be screened, and would also get the attention of someone who actually knew about the \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" film. When I went to my friend and former co-worker's house to do his last minute birthday party plans (for the third or maybe fourth time!), I could not bring myself to have one of my friends over and watch \"Forgive Me, Franklin\", but I have to admit that what drove me into helping to prepare this screening at the Film Festival was the fact that I wanted to find out more about how the film got its name...\n\nWhen I worked for film, I always felt that I was one part of the film industry, the one who was the one who was behind the movies. Now, that role was taken so by the young children who love the work that their films do, and now they will be the ones who can name it when this one is on the table.\n\nBut when I look back to my first job at \"Babylon Films\", there where many films that brought a smile to a parent's face and that they would be proud to give to others as well.

{"text": "human and mouse skin accumulate senescent cells in both the proliferative and reparative epidermis, it is clear that these two systems are not identical.[@cit0045]\n\nEpiDentin is produced from a common precursor, amelogenin. All mammalian amelogenins have a single zinc-binding domain, and when the zinc is removed, the polypeptide chain shortens, resulting in the formation of the amelogenin protein.[@cit0046] The amelogenins are encoded by a gene cluster comprised of seven genes, *A3*, *A4*, *A5*, *A6*, *A7*, *A8*, and *A10*, which are highly conserved across mammalian species. Each amelogenin gene is transcribed from a separate promoter, but together they form a larger polycistronic transcript. In addition to a single zinc-binding domain, the core polypeptide of each amelogenin has a glycine-rich domain that is rich in serine and threonine residue-containing hydrophobic amino acids [@cit0046]; this domain stabilizes the polypeptide in the absence of zinc. The glycine-rich domain mediates amelogenin monomers polymerization into dimers and tetramers, which further aggregate into hexamers and octamers.[@cit0046] Amelogenin is then secreted through a specialized secretion pathway that shares many features with the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein trafficking pathway that drives the trafficking of proteins from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER into the cell.[@cit0047] In vitro the hexameric assembly is formed from two zinc-free amelogenins that are co-incubated at low pH.[@cit0046] The hexameric amelogenin aggregate is then separated from the precursor monomers in a process that requires both calcium and ATP. This unique structural organization allows the secretion of amelogenins into the extracellular milieu via a multimeric oligomeric form.[@cit0046]\n\nThe process by which amelogenins are secreted from their respective gene promoters in a coordinated fashion is only partially understood. Mutation experiments have shown that the zinc-binding domain is necessary for transcription, while the glycine-rich domain appears to be dispensable for either the initial promoter activation or correct mRNA splicing in all six genes.[@cit0048] Further investigation shows that the zinc-binding domain acts as a transcription activation domain in the A3 gene, but not in the A4, A5, A6, A8, or A10 genes.[@cit0048] Furthermore, the transcription factors that drive gene transcription in the keratinocytes of mammalian skin are yet to be identified.\n\nAfter secretion the amelogenin polypeptide-polymer aggregate must be translocated into the extracellular matrix (ECM) through a specialized proteolytic complex ([Fig.\u00a01](#f0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}) that involves a transmembrane glycoprotein named meprin, a serine protease named furin, and a host of metalloproteases.[@cit0049] The initial interaction between the meprin transmembrane glycoprotein and meprin \u03b1 (meprin \u03b1) and \u03b2 (meprin \u03b2), both of which associate at the cell surface, is mediated by specific amino acid epitopes within the ectodomain of meprin \u03b1 [@cit0051] ([Fig.\u00a02A](#f0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) [@cit0046]. Once secreted, the meprin transmembrane glycoproteins are bound by the surface proteins mafA and mafB. These surface membrane proteins regulate meprin translocation, cell-matrix adhesion, cell shape, and cell migration.[@cit0049] Figure 2.Lateral migration of keratinocytes through their ECM. (A) Meprin (meprin \u03b1 or meprin \u03b2) and furin (frizzled/A-type) enzymes form a proteolytic complex that cleaves the precursor amelogenin to yield the mature amelogenins. The two mixtures undergo lateral migration toward the leading edge of the migrating keratinocyte. (B) The two proteolytic events necessary for lateral migration involve furin cleavage, which requires calcium and ATP to form a furin cleavage complex, and subsequent metalloprotease cleavage.

{"text": "the purpose of this study was to compare kinetic differences between a conventional extracorporeal centrifuge and an extracorporeal cell centrifuge.\n\nTwo groups of patients have been studied: in the group of 5 patients with severe congestive heart failure, a pump was implanted for the treatment of chronic heart failure. From the first three patients the pump could be removed without any complications in 5 and from the fourth patients this was possible with minor difficulties in the fifth. In the six patients who had the pump removed from their hearts in the course of the study, these were: after their first pump implantation, in the fourth patient.\n\nResults\n\nA centrifuge can be described as a closed system of a rotor, a drive shaft and a vessel which allows it to be filled and emptied to any desired extent. The vessel and the rotor itself are usually made of plastic with a heat stabilizing layer of polyurethane or similar material on both surfaces. The rotor is driven about its own axis by a drive shaft whose axis is connected to a rotor-fixed counter shaft. Inside the rotor is a hollow cylindrical rotor shaft about which passes the drive shaft. The rotors, which can be as large as 200 mm in diameter, are made of plastic or rubber and can be made of many different materials.\n\nWhen the rotor has reached a specific rotational speed by the centrifugal force of the fluid in the vessel, it has stopped for a moment, and on reversing the rotation by rotating the drive shaft, the vessel is emptied (if the speed is below 100 revolutions per minute) and will return to its full filling condition by the rotation of its drive shaft when the drive shaft is rotated through the same number of revolutions. It is important to note that only a very high speed of rotation (over 100 rev. per minute) will stop the vessel completely. At this high speed, however, blood will be completely stopped inside the rotation vessel in the shortest possible time.\n\nThe most efficient centrifuge may be used only if there is sufficient water- and electrolyte-stored capacity. The fluid can be pumped into the rotor tank, or a liquid can be pumped into the vessel by means of a pump connected to the drive shaft.\n\nA rotor that is used in a centrifuge is often made by winding steel wire in a spiral from the outer to the inner coil, with opposite turns of wire in the core and spiral in the coils. The coiling takes place with the direction of the axis of the spiral winding of the rotor axis (longitudinal direction of the axis).\n\nThe length of the spiral is often chosen at the upper part of the coil near the central axis of the coil. The coil is then wrapped with an appropriate thickness of the wire. At the same time the thickness of the coil is chosen in such a way that the maximum radial deformation of the coil during a short period may be avoided, and that the amount of the coil is not distorted, due to a nonmetallic layer forming on the wire.\n\nA rotor that is used in a centrifuge may also be made by various other methods, such as:\n\nBy passing a thin and flexible wire through an aluminum tube whose both surfaces are covered with plastic and hardened\n\nFusion welding\n\nBy passing a thin and flexible wire through a tube of plastic (polyamide or polyurethane) which is covered from above by a coating of plastic. The plastic tube is usually connected to a metal core through soldering the tubes to the core, the plastic (polyamide or polyurethane) is then covered from above by a metal layer\n\nBy coating the pipe with a plastic (polyamide, polyurethane) from above. The plastic film is rolled on by the wire or a blade, by means of an air knife or with an abrasive disk.\n\nThese methods require a great expenditure of time and materials and the quality is not always uniform.\n\nBy means of a spiral with flat spiral walls, made by rolling the spiral metal wire into a spiral on the cylinder axis of the cylinder.\n\nBy passing a thin flexible wire through an aluminum tube which is surrounded from above by a plastic coating with a thickness greater than 0.01 mm.

{"text": "as food becomes an important part of modern life, a kind of \"modern luxury\", because it is more portable, it is lighter, and therefore much cheaper to transport and distribute, and yet it may offer less flavor. There are foods that are good for you and are good to eat, but that you may not prefer to eat, for reasons of health or cost. There are food that you like, you really enjoy eating, but that tastes strange when you eat it. You don't really want to eat it. One thing to note about modern convenience foods is that they have gotten so complex that most people do not know what their food is doing anymore. They do not know what is in a jar. They do not know how it's made and what it does, they do not know how any one is using it.\n\nEven the foods that we think people buy, like Coca Cola bottles with a few cans of soft ice cream inside, or Pepsi cola bottles with a few cans of cola, are not actually \"food\" at all. They are mere containers. They are merely containers for other foods. Coca cola puts corn syrup into their soda, so that we can drink the same carbonated liquid and get a pleasant taste, that we always get at home with Coke. Pepsi puts artificial color in their cola so that people think it tastes like Coke, when in fact it is made of a substance called maltodextrin, which doesn't have any carbon dioxide at all.\n\nSome food goes through many of these different processes. These food \"lifestyles\" are extremely difficult to keep in mind. They are not like cars, because a different part becomes a different quality with different usage. One is not made in some factory, one is made in a lot of small processes and lots of different pieces, all working together as one unit to make a whole that is good enough to eat. One is good enough to eat, not just food that is good to eat, but food to last through the years. It has to be kept in a refrigerator, without water, and without the addition of other chemicals to extend the shelf-life or to change the taste.\n\nFood is an incredibly complex system. Everything that goes into it from the smallest grain of wheat to the largest fish has to fit together in very specific ways. It takes all kinds of special enzymes, the chemistry of each chemical, the temperature and pressure of each process and the exact way that chemicals interact all in the right order to make the final product that is tasty and nutritious. Food is designed as a machine for maintaining life, the machine of the body.\n\nIf you look down the middle of a loaf of bread, at the middle there is a \"meat\" that a knife cannot cut through, it is called the center of the loaf, it is the piece of \"meat\" that you are eating. The rest of the loaf is \"milk\" or \"lard\", it is the fatty, not edible meat on which you are eating. The meat itself is the good stuff, the milk which makes the bread is the bad stuff : in order from the beginning to the end, there is a process to make a tasty whole, a process to make something that is actually a whole thing in itself. This process starts out really simple and is like something we do all the time; by adding all the ingredients together and then we have an awful and tasteless blob. Add water and we have a tasty cake, something that is good to eat, a delicious dessert or a delicious breakfast, like a sandwich or a cake and drink. It is very natural that we want more, and more always means the same thing: more. When you have more bread than you can ever eat, you use less of an ingredient that makes the most delicious bread: water. If you have as many breads as you can consume, you become so fat, that you lose the taste of the bread; you no longer like the bread, you just prefer the filling, because of the same reason that we prefer soda over water, that there isn't enough water in it to make us like it.\n\nWe see this process continually repeating, and it is the basis of all things, including food. Food must be eaten in time, so it can be prepared when the right time come and when the food is good to eat. Food that is too far out of date is no longer good to eat. Not to say that the food will be even less tasty when it is gone; it might not taste any different, but you will just hate it more. We all hate things that are gone: you want what is left of the sandwich that was too old. The bread is gone; you are hungry and you are glad of the taste of the filling which is better than any bread, still you hate the bread and want the filling to stop.\n\nThe process by which this \"Milk\" is created, the process by which you add", "label": 1, "id": 100692}
{"text": "background : polycystic ovarian syndrome is one of the most common\nparaestheral disorders with an incidence of 3-5% that results in symptoms\nsuch as oligo-/anovulation, infertility, and irregular periods [9]. Symptoms\nof polycystic ovarian syndrome include hirsutism, hyperandrogenism and cysto-\ncrosis[8-10]. In menorrhagia\n(prolapse of the uterus), an enlarged uterus is visible on the pelvic front or is\ncaused by rupture of the uterus and a large amount of blood escapes, resulting\nin postmenopausal bleeding of a dark blood. Postmenopausal bleeding has been\nknown for being the most frequent and one of the most serious gynecological\ncomplication caused by pregnancy [12].\nDuring the early development of PCOS, high androgen production by the corpora\nlutea may lead to the development of cystic ovaries. This is associated with a\nluteal phase defect, i.e. a longer luteal phase and an insufficient production\nof progesterone. This results in increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue,\nhyperinsulinism and low estrogen levels. This also results in obesity,\nhyperinsulinemia, atherogenic insulin resistance, and polycystic ovarian\ntattoo. Other factors play roles in the development of cysto-crosis (cystitis)\ndue to bacterial infection, which may result in a chronic cystitis that may\nprogress and progress and may lead to cirrhosis and in the long term, to liver\ndestruction. For the treatment of a patient, both medical and non-medical therapy\nare recommended [9,10,17].\n\nTreatment with synthetic progestin is a method to reduce the ovulation and the\nperiodicity of menstruation. This method is an effective measure to treat\nmenorrhagia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with menstrual disorders\n[9,19-22]. This is due to reduction of progestogen secretion in the ovaries\n(treatment of the luteal phase defect) [23-27],\nalso reduction in the level of luteinizing hormone, which stimulates the\nproliferation of the corpora lutea, an increase in the progesterone of the\nfollicular phase and an increase in the progestogen [28].\nAfter the treatment, the irregular ovulation in the ovaries (polycystic ovary\nsyndrome) results in the reduction of the symptoms (menorrhagia) in the short\nterm and the maintenance of ovulation in the long term.\n\nAfter medical therapy, the treatment program often consists of therapy of the\novarian cysts, treatment of the increased intra-abdominal fat, lifestyle\nchanging, and hormonal replacement with oral progesterone-only therapy [16,20]. The\ntreatment of ovarian cysts during pregnancy is the third-line therapy.

{"text": "background : the consumption of low quality foods is common, the main reason for doing so being a lack of knowledge on how to prepare and cook such foods. This is a common belief especially amongst students. In many cases, they do not even know how to prepare or cook any food. The reason is their choice for the most palatable food they can. They choose the most readily prepared foods which are the least healthy and economical. They believe that the most readily available foods are the most healthy and economical as opposed to complex recipes that take hours and cost a lot of money. Hence they choose that simple foods and do not prepare complex meals that take more hours/money. Most students simply choose their favorite fast foods because they are easy to prepare or consume and easy to consume.\n\nHence the main aim of the study was to evaluate knowledge and preferences for preparing and consuming foods among undergraduate students of IBA. In an effort to accomplish this aim, the study used the SERVOD format for measuring consumer knowledge, consumer preferences and also food choice.\n\n2. Materials and Methods {#sec2}\n========================\n\n2.1. Samples {#sec2.1}\n------------\n\nIBA\\'s undergraduate students, mostly students of Biology department, were selected for this study by visiting their Department and obtaining the consent. These students were selected on the basis that they were from a state college in the state of Karnataka, India, with about 50,000 students in the IBA. They were students in the Pre-Batch, Bachelor of Arts degree courses for 3 years. Each student was asked to sign a written consent form and was selected on the basis of having an interest in food and using or having knowledge of cooking. Thus, an average of 12 students was included in each group and thus 18 samples were included in each of the groups.\n\n2.2. Design {#sec2.2}\n-----------\n\nThe design was a randomized sampling where the sample was divided by the food groups and then the students were randomly assigned to either A or B food groups. Thus, the design for the study was a cross sectional design, as a study involving multiple measurements will normally be a cross sectional design, i.e., the researchers selected a cross sectional sample using randomization. The researchers also ensured that the students were given no more than 5 food groups per day and had them choose 5 food groups from the list of 10 food groups that they were randomly assigned in the first stage of sampling. The researchers selected 4 students each in the food groups in the second stage. The researchers ensured that the students were given no more than 5 food groups per day for that particular food group in the second stage of sampling. The three researchers assigned the students randomly to an A or B food group. The three researchers who did not participate in the study had no participation during the interview sessions of the study. One researcher in each group recorded the outcome and also the sociodemographic characteristics of the selected students in the field diary. The researcher then used the data as the primary source for generating the sample size for the study. The sample size was derived using the following formula.\n\n$$n = \\frac{z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{2}}{\\delta\\sqrt{pq}}$$ [Figure (1)](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} is the flow chart for the study and [Table (1)](#tab1){ref-type=\"table\"} shows that the sample size was calculated as 19\u2009in total. This sample size of 19 could provide a confidence level of 95% that 80% of those recruited would not differ from those selected. Taking into account the error of 5%, the number required in each group was 10 in each group. Thus, a total of 15 students were selected for each group. Thus, a total of 45 students were randomly assigned to the groups for the interview and the food preference assessment. Group A was Food and Drink Group and Group B was Snacks and Beverages Group in this study. Thus, 45 students were randomly selected for this study as the sample was proportional to the population of the sample and is close to the sample size calculated (19 in each group). The selection of sample was randomized in the field by selecting 4 students each time from food groups in each group. The 3 researchers conducting the study were not part of it as they did not interact with the students or make changes to the study and were selected because of their expertise in the fields and did not interact with the students during or after the interview sessions. This research was carried out from February 12 to 20, 2013 and the data was collected in the academic year 2013-2014.\n\n2.3.

The UK Parliament is scheduled to vote on the fisheries agreement legislation on 14 and 15 February and then it is likely to be agreed by the European Parliament as early as 14 May.\n\nUK MEPs from the group of European People\u2019s Party (EPP) who wanted the UK to continue fishing on the basis of EU law.\n\nAccording to Mark Leonard, Chief Executive of the Marine Conservation Society UK, the proposed CFP would be the same as the existing UK CFP or it will put the UK further down the line, saying \u201cI think that\u2019s very much the case.\u201d\n\nHe said there are concerns the proposed changes could have implications for Scottish fish stocks, which, along with the rest of the UK, has to give a quota to EU nations for fishing on its waters.\n\n\u201cIf they want to put pressure on the member states for further conservation measures we will do what we have always done, that will be to continue to look to the other member countries to put pressure but of course we will have to agree a CFP with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would then look to other member states for conservation solutions and that will be one of the elements that the CFP must include.\u201d\n\nThe MEP group agreed that there needed to be more detail about how UK fisheries policy should operate in the longer term in the UK and how EU rules might operate differently in the future in the context of the forthcoming negotiations.\n\nThey were particularly critical of the wording of the proposed \u2018tolerance zone\u2019 which they would like to see in the CFP \u2013 \u201cfishermen from both sides of the English Channel working side by side on one piece of sea to be able to fish together in a very, very small area if they so wish, where they are fishing for the most part the same fish\u201d.\n\nThey also urged the UK to put a higher priority on the conservation role the UK could take in the CFP in place of the \u2018catch share\u2019 and quota system which they called an unnecessary \u201cconsequential system\u201d.\n\nWhat is included in the proposed framework of fisheries regulation?\n\nThe CFP is a framework agreement with all of the 28 EU states, designed to achieve common interests in regard to fisheries.\n\nIt is designed to ensure EU fleets manage fish stocks effectively with an EU-wide focus on stock protection. It provides for fisheries policies and management arrangements. It will ensure that EU and non-European fleets have access to fish catches under the existing European Union fishing operations as well as new fishery management arrangements within the European Union to cover fishery resources and sectors with special requirements. It sets out the rules on cooperation under a single fisheries policy and defines the key elements and the principle of the framework.\n\nIn October 2015, the European Commission published a document on the framework and the principles of the common fisheries policy (CFP).\n\nThe document was a product of the ongoing efforts of the common fisheries policy (CFP) working group, an intergovernmental body of representatives of the EU Member States and the European Parliament on fisheries, founded in October 2013.\n\nThe proposed framework is the product of a three-year consultation process, starting in September 2014 and ending in November 2016.\n\nThe report of the consultation describes a number of areas and elements, including objectives, principles and a list of potential actions.\n\nThe report contains ideas and proposals to harmonise fisheries practices and tackle marine pollution, which could give the European Union as much control of fisheries as other economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe European Commission will consider the proposals made by the working group,\u201d the European Parliament said at the time of publication.\n\n\u201cThe Commission notes with satisfaction the progress towards the objectives set out in the three-year time frame and welcomes the progress made in the consultation document with regard to these objectives.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Council and the Commission note that certain aspects of proposed measures or specific proposals are inconsistent with other EU policies and that others, in particular regarding access to the European economic area, have not been agreed with the Council as yet.\u201d\n\nThe council and the commission have until December 1 to say what they will do in response, at which point the working group report and the consultation document are to be forwarded to the European Council for confirmation.\n\nThe working group is composed of representatives for fishing, marine environment and marine policy from the EU Council, Parliament and the Commission.\n\nThe consultation is", "label": 1, "id": 100695}

{"text": "The concept of prime number is so important that it is used on the back of paper currency. As a measure of worth, it\u2019s used to distinguish the more valuable from less valuable currency.\n\nPrime numbers are the most important mathematical concept, as they stand for all other numbers, with each being less significant than the previous one.\n\nThe most important prime numbers are those that appear on the number line or in arithmetic (prime factoring).\n\nYou can check for the primeness of numbers by subtracting them from each other:\n\nThe number 5 has the number five prime factors, three prime factors, and no prime factors; 2 is 3 prime factors, 1 prime factor, and no prime factors; 17 is 13 prime factors, 10 prime factors, and 11 prime factors.\n\nThe number 1 has two prime factors (2 and 1), five prime factors (1, 4, 2, 3, and 5), and no prime factors.\n\nAnother interesting way to check primeness is by counting the divisors of a number:\n\nHow Can We Reduce this?\n\nWhat if in the expression, we replace all the primes numbers with a few common factor numbers in a list that contains prime numbers (with a little bit of flexibility on the ordering)? This is more elegant and less error-sensitive than finding a way to calculate the required primes numbers from the large collection above, but also comes at a cost as this requires lots of memory or other processing power to run, so it\u2019s used less now than in the past.\n\nWhat if you want all the primes numbers with a very large prime factor (say all prime numbers from 1 to 1000000) to be removed?\n\nInstead, how about if all the primes numbers with a very small prime factor (say all prime numbers from 1 to 10) are removed?\n\nThis is a nice one, especially if there might be a large prime factor in the list, but not as large as those above.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t always work. The reason is that a number is not considered prime when its proper divisors are all 1. For example, 19 is prime because 1, 3, and 5 are its proper divisors, but its prime factor is 9 because it\u2019s divisor is 1 is even and its divisor is 3 is odd.\n\nYou may need to do this to find all the prime numbers with an odd number of divisors, and all the prime numbers with an even number of divisors, etc. (This is called \u201cprimes factorization\u201d).\n\nThis is where the technique of prime number factoring comes in. The algorithm is very efficient and is much faster than the brute-force approach above or other fast algorithm\u2019s that factor primes.\n\nI won\u2019t go into details about the algorithm, or how to calculate the required numbers, because they are well-covered elsewhere.\n\nI just want to tell you why it\u2019s important for me to show you this! After learning the method of prime number factoring, I started doing calculations to find all prime numbers under a certain value for x (x was an arbitrary constant) such that no larger prime would be divisible by that large number.\n\nI usually use the prime number x=2147483647. You may use any arbitrary prime number.\n\nAfter doing these calculations, I was astonished by how many primes were divisible by x \u2013 not the small primes (the usual primes) but rather by many, many prime factors with relatively small factor numbers (of x). It\u2019s like they were lying.\n\nThese large primes were multiplying all other prime factors into an even larger number. If a number multiplied its divisor into a large prime number, then that number would be larger by a very large amount!\n\nThis \u201cprimes multiplying\u201d phenomenon was a mystery to me.\n\nSome people say that you are multiplying every divisor into the previous prime factor that the number being multiplied has, and then that is what you have. But how does this multiply an enormous factor into a very small divisor into a much larger prime number?\n\n\n\nI wrote the following code and experimented with it (see the code below).\n\nfunction PrimeFactoring(num) { var list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239,", "label": 1, "id": 100698}

{"text": "Well, Alyssa Edwards, you made a lovely fourth alternate. Although I agree with you regarding the way L.A. looks, I found another poster's interpretation way overbearing in terms of characterization. You are better served, I think, looking at the three characters you have chosen, not necessarily in terms of how they look or how they act, but instead with a keen and thoughtful knowledge of which traits the characters actually have and the reasons behind those traits. In the character studies you've done for the original, you've shown this ability to look at characters in a more balanced, analytical way, as well as to take a good look at yourself. I really appreciate this approach on your part of this series, as it is very unique, and a model of such writing requires some great personal conviction.\nThe problem we often encounter, and perhaps it's time to address it, is the tendency to write for a mass market by focusing on what we call, as I did above, the \u2018high fashion\u2019 aesthetics. What I\u2019ve noticed in such popular books as the \u2018Twilight saga\u2019 or even Stephenie Meyer\u2019s series, as well as many non-fiction books based on vampire tales for adults, is that many of the characters are written either as mere props or characters, or as props dressed up in clothes. I believe this is in the nature of the story, for example, a vampire can\u2019t really be that nice, unless one imagines a vampire as a very nice person in the beginning. And this also extends to some of the characters such as Elle and Jasper, where they are dressed up (literally) with a number of outfits, from the simple to elaborate, and the writing is just designed to make them look like the kind of characters we tend to imagine. But I was wondering if you see the need to bring some variety into things like, for example, vampires, where do the characters look if they truly cannot be that way (I.e. wearing the clothes, having the \u2018look\u2019)? Or again a character such as Jasper \u2013 how can one write his character, if he cannot be seen?\n\nSo, on the one hand we have the \u2018Twilight\u2019 and the \u2018Mummy\u2019 novels, where the characters are designed to look exactly how we see them, they are almost completely artificial creations (the most famous example being Maud \u2018Trixie\u2019 Faireborn, who becomes a vampire, and we know has to be a vampire because it is impossible for someone other than a vampire to turn into stone), and there is an important distinction in the difference between appearance and real life and the difference between \u2018artifice\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019. I think this makes sense, but what doesn\u2019t is why such a character would or could have been the way he is. You\u2019ve written about the \u2018Twilight\u2019 series in relation to your character of L.A., when she first appears, you write, \u201cAs L.A. is about to do her first vampire transformation, she looks over at Jasper for moral support, and finds him by the coffin. She knows where he is, and she knows about the vampire. Her reaction surprises Jasper.

But what he\u2019s not expecting, is she to turn him into one of the undead\u201d [4], which is the beginning of the character\u2019s transformation. Now what if this were never told, what if one can\u2019t know what happens later, and Jasper doesn\u2019t know that, at the beginning she never knew the vampires were out-of-control and out of control for a long time, and she never realised how beautiful the vampires could be? What if she had, like, lived in New York City, or in L.A. or something, instead of being in a hotel room in New York?\nNow this isn\u2019t to say that the series has to go on forever, I don\u2019t think it does, but it\u2019s almost as if one needs more than just the character of L.A. and Jasper to write the series, if everyone needs to be presented as they would appear were they in their natural habitat, then maybe the series could be written with a more complex and varied character. And I hope L.A. can become \u2018Twilight\u2019 with a different kind of protagonist \u2013 not a vampire, not a vampire hunter, a much different kind of protagonist. I wanted to say here, that by using Jasper as the protagonist the novels actually work quite well, and maybe the reason why the novels work well is because Jasper is such a complex character\u2026\n\nBut then I read your review and you write, \u201cMy only concern was that Jasper is", "label": 1, "id": 100700}

I mean, where can anyone find the words to understand what is happening in the world when, let me just say some nonsense. So, let's just take a moment as the thoughts pass through our heads\u2026\n\nWe are now in a fight against terrorism\u2026\n\nNo. Terrorism is not a single movement. It is many movements at the same time, but one would expect the one that is strongest at the moment to be the strongest. We are now in the middle of an ideological struggle that would put the likes of Osama bin Laden to shame.\n\nHe is not going to be going away, so why put him in the corner and give him nowhere to aim?\n\nThis is not going to end well.\n\nHe has no right to have a say in what is happening in Egypt and what is happening in Tunisia.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that I should be out in the open with this information as it is the reason behind this war.\nBut I am a mother and I don\u2019t have the right to tell whom we are allowed to talk about what is going on in the world.\n\nI am also a woman and I don\u2019t have the right to tell whom I can talk about what I see when we have a country that has been trying to take it\u2019s head out of the sand and look at reality.\n\nThe war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan\n\nNow we have entered a point of where we have no option other than to start a war against Afghanistan.\n\nI am not in favour of going to war with those countries, but we have no other option.\n\nThe United States\u2019 involvement is not in question. It is not as if we didn\u2019t have an argument about Iraq and Afghanistan that we would eventually lose.\n\nWe have a long history of war and this is a long process and we shouldn\u2019t let emotions change that fact.\n\nWe need to start preparing and finding a new strategy towards this war.\n\nBut once we have that we can begin to talk about how to deal with Pakistan and Afghanistan once we are no longer actively involved in either. It doesn\u2019t mean that we should go and invade both, but it would mean that it would be a two stage process:\n\nFirst we would have to take out those countries that have been deemed as threats to the United States.\n\nWe also need to take out groups like al-Qaida and whoever in Afghanistan. That doesn\u2019t mean we will go and occupy Afghanistan, but the countries they are in will be considered as target countries that we are going to kill or have to come in and occupy and fight them.\n\nThis would lead us to an area on the other side of Afghanistan.\n\nThis would put troops out and the country might move to a level of having a military conflict going on that is going to be as dangerous and unpredictable as Vietnam.\n\nWe need to give this a go, so we will be going forward with a plan that has been put in place with the involvement of the United Nations.\n\nOnce this is done we need to go back to Afghanistan, but the question about when we go back to Afghanistan and in what order has been questioned.\n\nThere is an argument about whether we should invade or not, but I don\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should fight. We should not be involved with people who think they are better than us, but our involvement does have to change to prevent other countries from just waiting for us to leave.\n\nAfter we get involved there has to be a timetable for when to leave so that we stay in it\u2019s position while that country doesn\u2019t get involved in Afghanistan. There have to be clear parameters.\n\nMy worry is that if we go in and try to move that timetable it will just cause more friction.\n\nThe main reason for our involvement is to gain leverage over this country.\n\nWe are fighting as one of the strongest coalition forces against terrorism and we are going to help the people fight against a group that is very hard to defeat.\n\nA war like this is something we are going to start to lose in another five to ten years.\n\nThe problem here is, and it\u2019s a very valid question, that we are trying to deal with Pakistan at the same time.\n\nThis is going to upset one of the things that we are trying to do because we are dealing with a Pakistan that does have a problem with terror and with dealing with it\u2019s own terrorists.\nIn the past we have dealt with terrorist groups using a military approach and it has resulted in positive results, such as the siege of Waco, but", "label": 1, "id": 100701}
{"text": "This projection was not included in the final summary for the National Highway System's 2009-2010 Transportation Research Board study. The NHTSA determined that the study of the National Highway System was premature since the costs to achieve the long range National Transportation Highway System goals were not known. The Board decided to develop its own plans, taking the top-level system that was developed when the study was developed, but removing some of the projects that have been identified as part of the long-range plans. The Board's long-range approach does leave more potential projects in the NHTSA's proposal, but the overall goals were not as ambitious as the long-lived long-range National System Strategic Highway Research program.\n\nThe National Highway System (NHS) is a key component of the federal Interstate Highway System (IHS); and an integral component of the planned national transportation system of the 21st century. It constitutes a backbone of new, heavy-duty highways, and provides a range of improved secondary roads, bicycle and pedestrian paths, and safety and mobility enhancements on existing highways. Because transportation is central to our physical and economic well-being, it is an important national priority, worthy of significant research and development efforts. The NHTSA and its transportation-research partners developed a three-level framework for conducting and evaluating research and policy development (see Figure 2).\n\nThe first level of the NHS framework is an organizational chart representing the five government agencies that are authorized to sponsor and finance or conduct research projects: (1) the Department of Transportation, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), (3) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), (4) the Federal Highway Administration, and (5) the General Accountability Panel (GAP).\n\nThe second level of the framework is the system level, which includes each national highway system (NHS), along with the nation's four regional highway systems. The regional highway systems are the Eastern, Texas, Southern, and Pacific (EAST, TEXAS, and SP) systems.\n\nThe third level of the NHS framework is the individual highway level, which includes each highway project. A highway project is defined as a set of actions, taken on a national- or state-wide or regional basis, designed to improve transportation through the application of new technology or existing technology. In total, the system level, the highway level, and the projects level represent all seven national, interstate highways. The NHS also includes multiple projects, or segments, of a highway project to provide for safety.\n\nThe four federal funding programs that support national highway research are the National Highway System Program, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Federal Highway Funding Program, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (TIFI) Programs, and the Highway Research and Development Program (HARD). The national Highway System Program is a program administered by the FHWA that provides a dedicated base of funds to support the research, development and deployment of highway infrastructure. In addition, each highway is eligible for other government subsidies, such as money for surface improvements and non-motorized roadways.\n\nEach highway is eligible for at least one program funding opportunity, and there are about 1,000 highway projects under consideration. The funding programs are discussed in more detail in the summary tables.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)\n\nFHWA oversees the national highway research programs and funds. Specifically, the FHWA is responsible for determining the needs of highway projects and deciding on the eligibility of each highway project to apply for funding under one of the five highway research projects. The FHWA is also responsible for evaluating and selecting projects for funding, providing funding allocations, establishing performance and cost benchmarks and performance levels for highway projects, and overseeing the application of the funds that are awarded under the five programs (see Tables 4 and 5).\n\nTable 4. NHS Project Funding Awards from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)\n\nNHS funding priorities\n\nThe FHWA, in consultation with its highway research partners, has developed a series of five research priorities (see Table 2).

The spin dependent term has the eigenvalues $E_i\\simeq U$, and the eigenenergies are nearly equal for the spin-independent and - dependent terms. This allows us to approximate the spin-dependence effect as if the spin-dependent term is absent and take $\\alpha_i =0$. In the absence of spin-dependent term, the effective Hamiltonian becomes $\\hat H_{int}^0=\\sum_{ij}Dm_{ij}\\hat n_i^{(I)}\\hat p_j^{(I)}$ with renormalized hopping integrals and the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping amplitudes are $D=1/N$ and $D=U/N$, respectively.

Thus, the intra - and - inter - orbital - hoppings contribute only to the kinetic energy term of the spin-independent term while the spin- dependent term is described by intra - orbital and - orbital hopping integrals for spin-down - electrons and inter - orbital hopping terms for electrons with spin. In terms of the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping amplitudes, the spin - dependent terms and the kinetic energy of the spin-dependent term can be written as $[{\\hat H_v}+{\\hat H_\\chi}]^2\\int_{v}\\frac{N}{2{E_t}}\\left\\{\\left[\\left(\\Delta_T^1\\right)^2+\\left(\\Delta_T^2\\right)^2\\right]\\cos^2{k}v+4D^2m^2\\sin^2{k}v_v \\cos^2{k}u_v\\right\\}\\frac{dv}{v}$, and $[{\\hat H_v}+{\\hat H_\\chi}]u_T^2k^4$ (spin dependent intra - and - inter - orbital interaction, and intra - orbital and - orbital hopping energy, respectively), respectively, with renormalized intra - and - orbital - hoppings $k=\\pi\\left(\\Delta_T^1+\\Delta_T^2\\right)/d$ ($u_T(v)$ is the band velocity of the spin- dependent terms, and it depends on the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping integrals; $\\Delta_T^1$ and $\\Delta_T^2$ are related to the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping integral; and the effective hopping integral can be rewritten as $\\tilde D=D-\\alpha_T^2$, where $\\tilde D$ is the renormalized band energy of the spin-dependent term which includes the interaction only with all spin-up electrons, and $\\alpha_T$ is the interaction parameter, i.e., the spin-dependent hopping integral between different bands for spin-up electrons.

{"text": "I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it was the first really \"grown\" up horror movie I have seen - it had very adult themes and the plot was interesting. It scared me a lot but I loved it. That's what the whole thing was about, the characters and their lives.\n\nSo basically, what you guys were basically saying is that there wasn't much in the way of \"horror\" in there (like in Silent Hill 3, or for that matter even in Resident Evil 2 : not much in the vein of this).\n\nDid you even watch the movie with a pair of sunglasses on? It wasn't exactly a haunted house with ghosts.\n\nIt wasn't the same thing but yeah, I remember sitting in the theatre and listening to it with my headphones on and it was the first horror film I've ever seen where the characters were actually creepy.\n\nI think they were trying to have it make a little bit of a statement, because it was based on a horror novel and a horror short story series by Stephen King (his daughter mentioned it, so that's something).\n\nA lot of time was wasted trying to be something other than \"just a movie again\" - one reviewer said it had the best \"dub work\" of the entire series (they did this often), that there wasn't any scary scenes, that the ghosts weren't really scary, etc.\n\nThe thing that probably killed it is that they tried to be scary by using a lot of visual effects (and it looked bad, and tried to be scary, and tried to be scary, and tried to be scary with the acting, and then made it all seem like they had a lot of fun with it, and then tried to hide it with an ominous score and then tried to hide it with the \"haunted house\", and then tried to hide it with the'spooky' stuff, etc. The only reason \"Night Shift\" became so popular was that it was actually scary) - everything was trying to be a little bit scary in terms of special effects in order to put people on their feet.\n\nAt least they came up with the zombie in their own time, then it was like \"Okay cool! Zombies! You think it'll scare the hell out of people who want a lot of \"gore\"? We do have the ability to \"make people afraid.\" But then, the film went to the cheap route and used the \"weird creature\" as it's main theme.\n\nSo, in the end, I guess it was good - it had the actors and the cast on their feet the whole way through, but they never had much interaction with the audience, and the actors were the ones who seemed to get a lot of \"scare\" out of it.\n\nWhen I see this film (or it was when I saw it in theatres, I forget) I got more scares from the previews of it than I did the actual movie itself. What are you guys talking about? It's a film that had a lot of \"cool\" and \"interesting\" things added to it to get the right \"feeling\" for the main story. Maybe too much, but in the end it's a good film. The ending left you thinking it was a good movie. I think you would have better luck trying to find the good in a bad movie!\n\nI don't know what to say about this film. I've never really understood horror films - it's just too \"over the top\". What can I say, I see it as an art film made by an art film fan trying to make some kind of creative statement. When I saw the previews of this I thought the film had no depth and was a big mess - but once it came out I was surprised how much depth there is. Sure, the characters aren't realistic but I think it's the characters that make the film. For example I think it's really well done because I see the performances and the acting and I see the writers doing something interesting - maybe some of you guys could elaborate on that. My other favourite character in it is the creepy girl on TV whom I think will turn up in one of the follow-ups. She was so well done and made to feel like an oddball yet believable.\n\nI don't know how many horror films I've seen and still prefer the Stephen King original. I'm not sure anything has changed, horror films have become over the top and there are so many movies out there now. Just looking at the comments on this review gives me goosebumps! It's funny, I thought this would be the perfect horror film where you could just sit down with a group of friends, watch as the camera rolled and everyone was acting like a crazy person. But then I see reviews of Stephen King adaptations like these, and I wonder how come they are so good and where could it go wrong (the end). It's quite frustrating. But I", "label": 1, "id": 100704}
{"text": "Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which the virus could invade the body. They include lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and infection with human herpesvirus-8. More precise information was gained with the identification of virus-binding sites. Virus infection triggers immune reactions that increase the permeability of blood vessels. This allows the virus to enter the blood and infect the organs \\[[@CR1]\\]. Since the virus can cause a severe and often fatal disease, it is necessary to consider infection with this virus in patients with various disease profiles.\n\nThe present report describes the clinical characteristics of six patients who presented with an altered mental status (AMS) and fever that was preceded by a viral infection. A causal relationship was not established with the viral disease reported herein, but the patient's condition was improved with a reduction in the intensity of medication.\n\nIn the present report, two men and four women between 70\u00a0years of age and 60\u00a0years of age, respectively, were seen. Three of the people involved were non-smokers and two of them were ex-smokers. One person had no underlying disease at the time of diagnosis, and the other had diabetes complicated by nephrosis. Two out of the six cases were positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and were taking combination anti-retroviral medications. The other two individuals did not have an identifiable risk factor for their infection.\n\nA recent history of fever or body aches preceded the onset of an altered mental status (AMS) in two of the six patients in the present report. All of them had a history of an upper respiratory tract infection or a common cold. The first two patients, who were 60\u00a0years of age and 80\u00a0years of age, respectively, presented with a fever of 40.8\u00a0\u00b0C and a body aches that began on the 2nd day after the symptoms. The body aches were relieved without the use of any medication. The other four patients described a similar history of a fever of 37.2--38.6\u00a0\u00b0C that began in the early morning, and all of them visited a physician after the onset of the disease, and all four patients were given antibiotics, and one received an increase in the medication dose. A laboratory examination conducted on the last day of fever revealed the following: the white blood cell count was 13\u2009\u00d7\u2009103/\u03bcl (normal range\u2009=\u20094--10), and the platelet count was 30\u2009\u00d7\u200910^4^/\u03bcl (normal range\u2009=\u2009130--350). Two patients also used steroids in addition to antibiotics. The patients' mental status was also examined. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 11 for the first two patients before any treatments, while it was 17 for the remaining patients. The results of neurological examination were normal in the first patient. In addition, there was no impairment in the second patient.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), febrile viral infections can cause mental and behavioral disorders, such as confusion, disorientation, and amnesia. It can also cause the development of delirious state due to a viral infection with the potential to cause mental disorders \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\].\n\nSome studies reported that patients with a febrile viral infection may have behavioral disturbances, such as psychosis and delirium \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\]. The authors of one of those studies believe that a combination of immune and nutritional factors that are produced during early infection may result in emotional turmoil \\[[@CR6]\\].\n\nIn the case of the first patient in whom fever and mental status signs occurred, the patient visited the emergency room after the onset of the symptoms and complained that the body aches left a bad taste in his mouth. Two weeks before the onset of the symptoms, the patient experienced fatigue that began in the early morning. Fever was not detected in the preliminary diagnosis, and these symptoms were not explained. Blood was drawn on the second visit, and the results revealed high fever with a temperature of 37.6\u00a0\u00b0C. The patient also complained of headache. Due to the fact that the symptoms worsened, the patient visited the hospital. This report is limited to the case of the first patient. A medical history was not obtained from the second patient.\n\nThe second patient who presented a body aches beginning on the second day after the onset of fever was diagnosed with amniositis accompanied by elevated white blood cell count. The laboratory examinations revealed the following levels: white blood cell count was 16\u2009\u00d7\u2009103/\u03bcl (normal range\u2009=\u20094--10), and the platelet count was 38\u2009\u00d7\u200910^4^/\u03bcl (normal range\u2009=\u2009130--", "label": 1, "id": 100705}
{"text": "the abundance of both amorphous and crystalline silicates in very low-mass\nplanetary material, and, moreover, both seem to coexist in the same\ncompositions (Lunine et al., 2001a). A possible explanation for this is\nthat the presence of crystalline compounds is not a property of a\nrandomly-selected sample of particles, but instead a property of the\nparticles themselves. The particles that are found in meteorites are\nnaturally a combination of the component grains from the asteroid that has\noriginated them and other meteoroid grains that were delivered from other\nsources to be incorporated in the meteorite.\n\nThe particles of any particular meteorite that was synthesized inside the\ncomet's or asteroid's nucleus would tend to have very different\nproperties from the particles that were produced in the outer regions of the\ncratonic disks around the parent body. It is possible that some\nmaterial that is observed in meteorites, particularly in the early stages of\nthe accretion process, is actually a mixture of particles that have been\nconverted from components delivered from inside the nucleus over time. Thus,\nnot all the particles that are in a meteorite are of asteroid origin.\n\nThe properties of meteorites were once primarily interpreted in terms of\ncomposition and growth of minerals derived from the surface of asteroids and\nfrom the cometary nucleus. Over the past 30 years it has been recognized that\nboth elements and compounds that are common in meteorites are also found in\nmany other meteorite types (Lunine et al., 2001a,b; Pravec, 2002).\nThe meteorite that is known as Chiron is the most pristine carbonaceous\ntype mineral that we know of, containing 99.5% carbon with varying amounts of\nsilicate minerals (Pravec, 2002). The meteorite with the name Pallas,\nwhich is a silicate of iron and sulfur, as well as rare-earth-element\ncontaining rocks, is the most primitive meteoritic material in terms of\nchemical and mineralogical characteristics (Lunine et al., 2001a). The\ncompounds in both meteorites are essentially carbon, hydrogen, and silicon\ncompounds in chemical equilibrium, with the other elements being all\ntraceable to rock-forming elements in the Earth's crust.\n\nSome authors in recent years have claimed that some materials in meteorites\nare, in fact, the products of meteorite-impact or asteroid-based processes.\nFor example, there are no trace amounts of water (Owen, 1999), oxygen (M.\nC. Wetherup, 2000), and even radioactive elements (K. K. Kuiper, 2002;\nPravec, 2001). Although these claims remain unproven, some recent studies\n(Zellner 1991; Kuiper and Wetherup, 2000; M. C. Wetherup, 2000, 2003a,b;\nPravica and Wetherup, 2003) have shown that meteorites that contain materials\nthat are similar to the products of impact processes contain material with a\nbacteriological and chemical composition that cannot be explained by the\nconveyors-belt model used when describing the delivery of the materials from\ntheir parent bodies (Pravica & Wetherup, 2003). The materials in meteorites\nthat are difficult to explain by a conveyor-belt model are very reactive and\nsometimes highly toxic, such as those in meteorite Zakhara (Burr,\n1971; Kuiper, 2002). There is even evidence of compounds that are formed in\nthe interior of a meteorite that are not found on the comet, suggesting a\nprocess that occurs during delivery of the meteorite to a planet or to\nanother star (Pravica, 2003; Pravec, 2003).\n\nIt is obvious that the properties and composition of meteorites are very\nvaried and can be affected by the chemical composition of the grains that\noriginate the meteorite itself (Pravec, 2001). It is possible that materials\nthat are unusual for a specific meteorite type cannot have originated from\ncomposition effects of the grains that formed in the parent body, but might\nhave been produced during delivery of the meteorite into the nebula. It would\nbe interesting to find meteorites with unique and previously unobserved\nproperties.\n\nAt one time it was thought that elements would always have been present\ninside and on the surfaces of meteorites. Some authors, however, have said\nthat there are trace amount of elements that do not naturally occur\n(M. C. Wetherup, 2001). The presence of such materials raises some problems.\nFirstly, how does a meteorite enter the planetary system without the\naddition of such potentially dangerous elements such as uranium and\nplutonium?

{"text": "While in a plane, flicking through the large choice of snacks, you notice the flight attendant\u2019s serving tray. Usually, but not always, your flight starts with cheese slices and nuts.\n\nFlurry and energy (and whatnot) may be expected. It helps them get through the next hours of a routine. As such, those cheese/nut trays become important items to keep handy for when the work day and the rest of the day takes a breather. We all know those who keep a spare change of them in their pockets or purse somewhere. Well, the time you put toward the food tray might be the most productive time you could spend when in flight.\n\nThis applies as much to your travel as eating, as your food plan will depend on which type of food you consume on a regular basis (and what time of the day you find it most helpful). It is worth considering the type of foods you prefer to eat. And since you will often be sitting down, take care of your table (or at least the tray) accordingly. It is a good idea to order several snack foods to make enough food for those who consume it daily or even on an occasional basis. So for this you can either order your foods in advance or by picking them out at a certain time at a counter where it doesn\u2019t require a meal fee from the passenger to enjoy that particular food (such as a snack bar or the food/snack tray).\n\nIn some cases, however, the food tray is a simple option to fill up the table with. It includes some bread (for more fiber), fruit, nuts, yogurt, cookies, or even candy (for something sweet) and maybe a drink. But it would pay to make sure to order some nutritious or more health and balanced snacks for those who will eat what they are served.\n\nIt will certainly bring down the number of empty spots in the flight in a timely manner if everyone is served food in their tray\u2019s (or in the food/snack trays\u2019s) place. It also enables the flight attendant to rest or take a few breaks instead of working the complete period. And in my experience, the flight attendants appreciate a flight when most passengers are happy and it also means less fatigue being experienced by them during a flight.\n\nHaving breakfast at the flight will be even better if it is of the healthy variety. They will find it harder to resist when you are offering them healthy options. Thus, make sure to offer some with which they will appreciate, which the flight attendant\u2019s tray will never do.\n\nDo Your Homework before Flying\n\nIt is no surprise to many who fly that their flight schedule always becomes very stressful. People are often forced into uncomfortable situations, as flights are rarely scheduled well. Often times, flying is a very stressful routine.\n\nThis includes delays, cancels and long delays that make people want to check-their-destination-flight-status. There is often much frustration flying.\n\nMany airlines will try to cut your flying cost by offering lower prices to the consumers. This often comes at your expense when you need to delay your flight because of delays you never realized there were in flights coming in the next hour.\n\nBut not only do airlines need to cut costs but also they want to make your trip as convenient as possible. That means providing the best services possible. As such, they need to improve their food service offering and their baggage handling for the convenience of the customers.\n\nIt is no wonder that a lot of people are trying to improve their flying times by finding out the best ways to fly. Often it involves scheduling an overbooking or overbooking. Having a few hours to catch a later but more convenient flight is a great perk. And it always provides more time, as the passenger has had more time to prepare for the overbooking.\n\nHaving the flight overbooked brings a lot of inconvenience to the passenger, as well as the flight attendants. But it also brings an extra benefit. This is why travelers want to know when to book the right flight overbooking. An overbooking is not supposed to happen, but it still happens every year or so. The best way for passengers are to know which airline is always willing to overbook and in the very beginning of the flight and wait for the last flight before the other passengers.\n\nHaving this knowledge before the flight, makes it easy for the passenger to have a much better travel experience. The customer can easily book an overbooking well in advance of the flight.\n\nIt is no secret to people who fly that airline prices can vary depending on many factors. Usually, the lowest prices for travel fare do not exist in the lowest price range. That is the reason why it is possible to buy a flight that is half the price of an airline ticket but has much more of an inconvenience.\n\nIt has been a few years since the last time the airline industry experienced", "label": 1, "id": 100708}

The questionnaire asked relatives to define the level of satisfaction with the patient, and to describe what improvements could be made in order to achieve greater satisfaction. This questionnaire was sent to 1268 (96.5% response) patients.\n\nc.  *Results.* We found that patients who were satisfied with their lives had a significantly more active life, a better relationship with their children, and were less lonely than those who were not satisfied. Improvements were made in many areas, including relationships with relatives (more satisfied), mental health (less depressed), and physical health (more physically active).\n\nd.  *Conclusion.* The findings suggest that improved relationships with relatives and active patients can have positive effects on the health and well-being of patients, and that the process of dying for the patient plays an important role in the outcomes for relatives.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0126889.t006\n\n###### Patient satisfaction with care.\n\n![](pone.0126889.t006){#pone.0126889.t006g}\n\n  \u00a0                           Satisfied   Not satisfied   Total       \n  ---------------------------- ----------- --------------- ----------- -------------\n  **Family satisfaction**                                             \n  \u00a0My life is easier          30,7 (1.4)   15.3 (2.6)      20,3 (2.5)   28.4 (4.3)\n  \u00a0My life is worse           25,9 (1.3)   8.5 (1.2)       14.7 (2.1)   18.6 (2.4)\n  \u00a0I am satisfied             35,1 (0.5)   16.3 (1.4)      11,1 (2.0)   46.3 (2.5)\n  **Patient satisfaction**                                             \n  \u00a0Better to die without pain   34.0 (0.6)   6.9 (0.9)       3.0 (0.3)    33.0 (0.9)\n  \u00a0Better to die at home       14.9 (0.3)   3.0 (0.3)       0.7 (0.0)    14.9 (0.7)\n  \u00a0No worries about dying      32.6 (1.0)   22.3 (1.1)      12.1 (0.8)   39.9 (1.1)\n  \u00a0More independent           25.9 (1.5)   20.0 (2.0)      6.1 (1.0)    37.3 (1.0)\n  \u00a0No regrets about dying      30.8 (0.5)   10.7 (0.8)      6.1 (0.4)    37.8 (0.5)\n  \u00a0Better future for patients   26.9 (0.5)   4.0 (0.4)       4.0 (0.3)    26.9 (0.5)\n  **Relatives satisfaction**                              ", "label": 1, "id": 100709}

{"text": "we investigate a condensed matter `` black hole '' analog. Our motivation is to understand the structure of a black hole by analogy with atomic physics, the two fields being not only unrelated but also fundamentally opposed. A comparison is made with a quantum black hole using the language of condensed matter physics. We find that the two theories are indeed very similar. One can relate some exact properties of the quantum black hole such as entropy and black hole entropy gap with the condensed matter theory. It is however difficult to derive general results, and more work has to be done to clarify the basic issue of the similarity of the two theories. One of our final results is to find a correspondence between the effective black holes of the two theories, namely black holes of the condensed matter theory. Black holes in condensed matter physics are called ``partons`` in the terminology of high energy physics. On the other hand, one often finds the effective black holes of condensed matter theory in condensed matter physics. One is tempted to speculate on the relation between the two terms. We leave a further investigation on this topic to future work.\n\nWe review how to use a quantum computer to find a better approximation to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (SE) than is typically possible using classical computers. This is a special case of a more general idea: by using a quantum computer to approximate the SE, one could get an improved answer by quantum-mechanically measuring some properties of the quantum computer (for instance, by using a quantum circuit). We define a ``measurement circuit``, which serves as the basic building block of an approximation, and show that there is a quantum circuit (based on Clifford operations) realizing the transformation (which is non-unitary) that maps an initial state of the SE to an equivalent state in which the approximate eigenfunction has more peaks or is better localized. Our quantum circuits are polynomial size and are well suited to be used as building blocks for quantum algorithms to approximate SE. Examples of quantum algorithms that can be done with these circuits include quantum Fourier transform, quantum search, and matrix inversion. We also discuss how such circuits are used in practice.\n\nWe extend the work of Brannan and others, who showed that certain Hamiltonians with random anisotropic interactions can be represented using effective 1-particle Hamiltonians that are very different from the usual 1-particle Hamiltonian of the isolated system. For instance, at low temperatures, effective Hamiltonian approaches to a 2-dimensional harmonic quantum rotor in free space have higher energy than that of the full quantum Hamiltonian due to the additional interaction, while at high temperatures the opposite is true.\n\nWe construct new families of exact solutions of the nonlinear equation that governs the dynamical evolution of black hole spacetimes with time dependent coupling constants, which are different from the previously known solutions. These solutions are classified using two non-linear parameters, namely a combination of the gravitational scalar and the non-linear component of the metric. When these two parameters are fixed and the corresponding free Hamiltonians can be expressed solely in terms of the dynamical variables, we are able to find exact solutions.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce two new exact solutions of one-dimensional integrable models with inverse power law potentials. The existence of these two solution is studied in detail, including solutions with negative energy and solutions that do not exist for a single value of the coupling constant.\n\nWhen one wants to predict the dynamical behavior of complex nonlinear systems and analyze their stability from the dynamical viewpoint, the simplest method is to expand the general solution of the system in series or in integral form. One then can use the coefficients of the respective expansions to study the dynamical behavior. The aim of this article is to present the general method of solution in which one can obtain the series and integral solutions by some appropriate transformations. The method can be used to derive the solution of the general system, and also to study its evolution with time for a given initial condition. In this approach, one can use general formulas of general series and in particular those from the theory of the infinite series of series. It is also possible to use general methods of integration. To illustrate this method, we give in this paper four representative examples from various fields. We investigate the influence of numerical integration over initial conditions on these four classes of solutions, and show that their comparison gives an effective criterion for the choice of numerical integration in numerical solution procedures. Further, we show examples of the use of these techniques for the study of complex dynamical systems.\n\nA new type of black hole was discovered. Its mass, surface gravity and entropy can be determined by observation but the details of its internal structure remain a mystery. We introduce methods to calculate the internal structure of this object, based on methods in classical black hole thermodynamics.\n\nIn our earlier work we have shown that the classical black hole solution with a scalar field presents a new kind of dynamical", "label": 1, "id": 100711}

It\u2019s going to bring me so much comfort and happiness in writing this final chapter. I never thought I would say this and I was worried if I would write it down, but I have finally found an honest way to end this amazing journey. I hope you can find it as rewarding as I am to write about, knowing that we left this musical journey far too early. I am so grateful we made it so far. I will never forget this musical journey and I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. Please know there is so much more to come for this amazing musical!\n\nA Musical Journey of a Survivor\n\nI am happy to share this final chapter, but it will not be a sad one for me. This journey with my family was my favorite one to walk on. I have never lived in poverty and was raised in an upper middle class family. We had everything we ever wanted and it all happened because of how my family and people around our place supported me. I feel privileged to have experienced such an incredible life with my parents and siblings. I have no regrets because we had the most amazing life. No one will ever question that what we had is the most blessed thing. This was not all because of people working in the community, but many people helping my family to survive. This is a big achievement that I will never forget. It was through my family that I realized if we give up anything, we deserve it, and we have been given far, far, much more than we could ever imagine.\n\nMy siblings and I came in search of opportunities while raising our parents. They were surviving in an unproductive poverty situation. It was a nightmare for us to raise them both in such an environment. However, through the grace of God, it all worked. Our parents gave us the most amazing gift of an education to enable us to build an even better future for our family. This was a family in search of a better future and together, we gave them back more than they had. We taught our parents an incredible lesson, which is that they are not the only ones blessed with a good life, we are blessed in turn. I feel so privileged to have been raised in a better and better environment. I feel blessed that we will have the same opportunities that other people come across.\n\nI am not the only one who feels proud for having raised my siblings who is going in the wrong direction. My friends are growing up in the right environment. I am honored to even be a part of such a powerful story and am honored to be a part of an amazing musical that made an impact on the world. Every time I think of how we came to be apart, it makes me realize that the Lord has truly blessed us. Through such a hard experience and through such a difficult journey we have experienced, I now feel that the Lord has made it possible for us to experience these amazing moments in life.\n\nIt is my honor to be able to share my story with you. These were the most wonderful moments of my life, which I will never forget. I wish my family could be there, but I know they are better off staying in the real world. I will never let them down as I remember I stood up for them with all my might. We are blessed and we will continue to be blessed in the years to come.\n\nHow we are now going to leave you, I do not know. There is not much more we can say about this part of our lives. We can share our journey with you, but we cannot say much. I hope you have enjoyed our journey with these lyrics in your soul. I was always in the mindset that at the end of this journey people will remember the music of our journey.\n\nWe came out of this world better persons. We left this musical journey better than when we entered it. However, we have so much more, we have left a legacy behind us. One such legacy is that we will always have a wonderful story that we believe in, regardless of the circumstances in which we have experienced and the pain we have been through. We just continue to believe in God\u2019s goodness, and we continue to be thankful for the blessing and opportunity in our lives. Even in the darkest moments during our musical journey, I believe in our Lord. I have been taught to never walk away from a tough challenge, I think that\u2019s why I am still here. I am hoping I can inspire others during this last day, to believe in their Creator and keep going no matter what hardships life throws at us. Thank you for your support and we will keep you updated on the rest of our journey.\n\nFrom the end of time, the universe was not created to stand still but have constant change.

{"text": "31 December 2015 Last updated at 16:30 GMT BBC News The UK government has backed away from its pledge to extend some benefits for illegal workers, it emerged today, after a series of rows over migrants' immigration status. \"There is no point in paying benefits to illegal migrants,\" said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which runs local benefits systems in England and Wales. In a move unlikely to encourage illegal immigrants to be better integrated into the UK, the department also announced that it would no longer carry out checks at ports of entry to see if people have correct employment or immigration status documents. The move appeared to indicate that the UK, like the US, was determined to get out of immigration rules that are causing deep resentment amongst many illegal immigrants. The government's long-standing position on illegal immigrants is being undermined by two factors: The number of foreign nationals who get into trouble at the UK's borders is estimated to be between 11 and 14 million. The government estimates that this is equivalent to between 3 and 5 million illegal immigrants. \"If people were able [to] show it, I suppose people are going to work here, then they'd have the capacity to show their immigration status,\" said Lord Malloch-Brown, who is chairman of the Migration Council. \"And the government are now backing away from the position they should be backing away from.\" Lord Malloch-Brown told the Press Association he was sure many of those working legally in Britain would appreciate the government abandoning its policy stance in the face of widespread public anger over immigration. Lord Malloch-Brown, the new chairman of the Migration Council, said that it was important migrants had secure and legal protection in the UK. \"I don't think they understand that they will be discriminated against if they are treated as if they were illegal or they will suffer in the workplace if everyone is treated like as if they are not citizens,\" he told the Press Association.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

{"text": "Did Clear Weather Play a Role in JFK's Assassination?By Samantha-Rae Shafer\n\nAlthough many historians and conspiracy theorists believe assassination was a staged show to get rid of JFK, he was assassinated under clear weather conditions.\n\nSome claim weather was the key factor in his murder.\n\nWeather was not the only conspiracy theory that has surfaced regarding the JFK assassination. Many believe the CIA staged the crime, with Weather being the key.\n\nIn an article featured on the JFK Library page titled \u2018Was the 9/11 Conspiracy a Weather Extraterrestrial Event?\u2019, author William Martin reveals that, according to weather experts, John Kennedy may have become a target because of his position within the government. Martin quotes the author as saying, \"The U.S. presidents are the least predictable people in the world. With the possible exception of weather, you just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\"\n\nAnother report states that JFK was assassinated because his wife had been \"out of the loop\" on various decisions with JFK and his advisors, and that JFK\u2019s actions were inconsistent with his character and position in the government - in addition to being the president of the United States.\n\nJohn Kennedy was involved in some controversial decisions, such as his decision not to get involved with the Cuban Missile Crisis. This decision is one of many conspiracy theories that accuse President Kennedy as being either a \"liar, a traitor, or a weak leader\" that does not care about his country.\n\nJFK became a target because of his wife, Jackie Kennedy, who was a divorcee, after his first marriage had crumbled - but he continued with his second marriage. With all of this happening, Kennedy was the most important member of the government - a position, which led other presidents before him in line. In addition to all of the above, JFK was in a position of power, where he could change certain policies that he may have thought were good, before he was removed from office\n\nAfter JFK was assassinated, it was not determined that it was a conspiracy, but rather a \u201cconspiracy within a conspiracy,\u201d that, according to some, the CIA was behind the assassination. Even with all things from the assassination of JFK, whether or not John Kennedy\u2019s assassination was a government conspiracy remains in dispute.\n\nIt could be that there were several different conspiracy theories regarding JFK\u2019s assassination. In an article titled \u201cJFK \u2018Conspiracy\u2019: The Truth,\u201d author Steve Coll reports that many \u201cconspiracy theories have surfaced during the last decades which question, or even question whether the Kennedy Assassinations was a plot engineered by the CIA.\u201d Coll reports that there is a theory, in which people are talking about \u201cThe Day Kennedy was Killed and No Other Power Was Able to Conceal It.\u201d\n\nPeople believe that Kennedy would be a victim of a terrorist attack or, as author David Horowitz writes, that JFK could have been assassinated by CIA agents on March 30, 1964. Horowitz wrote, \"It's a fair bet that he was killed by a mob hit ordered by the CIA and the LBJ-Nixon team.\"\n\nOther conspiracy theories, whether they claim that JFK was shot without a second shot, or that there were two bullets striking JFK at the same time, or that there were two bullets found at the scene of the crime, or some other theory. Some people also claim that JFK would be a victim of a \u201cspy\u201d, such as William Colby.\n\nSome people speculate that the CIA did it, including the assassination of JFK, because they were angry with a Republican president, Richard Nixon. At this point, Nixon is blamed when it was discovered that in 1968, the CIA had planted spies in the government. Many believe that the murder of JFK was ordered by President Nixon, who was running for re-election. Some believe that Kennedy may have been murdered because he was not only pro-witness, but also, he may have been involved in the murder of two other people. These include J.F.K.\u2019s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and his brother, Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe theories that state Kennedy\u2019s death was a CIA-orchestrated crime, is called the \u201ccovert assassination theory\u201d. The author of an article on the JFK Library wrote, \"I suppose it could be said that without this conspiracy, JFK might have been alive today.\" This theory is supported in the popular media by those who believe, they can prove that Kennedy was assassinated by a group of anti-government and anti-Republican, white power, radical extremists.\n\nThe \u201ccovert assassination theory\u201d does have a few major problems, however, some people believe these problems do not even exist. According to Steve Coll who wrote a \u201cThe John Kennedy Conspiracy: The Truth\u201d, the major problems that", "label": 1, "id": 100720}
{"text": "this review summarizes our present knowledge about elderly people's risk and resilience to loneliness in relation to: (a) personal dispositions, (b) social ties and social networks, (c) social integration and social capital, and (d) health. It contributes to the social research on aging that combines a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu's concepts of capital and social capital with a set of indicators relevant to vulnerable groups. As suggested by Bourdieu's structural economic thinking, we have shown that the concept of social capital can be linked to Bourdieu's concept of capital. Furthermore, our study gives evidence that social capital is protective and risk-reducing when facing aging challenges, which makes it a novel protective resource that helps aging people remain connected to existing social networks. Therefore, we have proposed \"being connected to social capital\" - a concept that complements the \"being connected to families and persons\" as traditionally employed. Finally, we conclude by pointing out that aging processes are accompanied by changes in health and social variables that impact on aging in the broader sense of the term.", "label": 1, "id": 100721}

{"text": "Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, I have researched this one on Wikipedia and am in need of some help to resolve some issues that come up in my mind, so I shall ask again, can any one kindly point out where is the most logical flow and logical sequence that can be traced to describe this film, or, at least guide this post with any reference link or something to that effect, or at least answer in detail?\n\n1.Why there will be three \"heroes\":\n\n2.Why people will not like that this hero comes from different country and one of them is not really so 'good'? (Like I'm not really fond of this hero, I have to say he/she is a bit \"anti-social\" and uncivilised, however that is another story.)\n\n3.Why the hero is quite close to these 'heroes'? Is it natural for a hero to always go against the norm? Like, I can easily imagine any good and peaceful guy trying to find peace in his life if he were one with such people? But this thing is a fantasy, or a simulation? And why not the real, real \"good\" world if this hero was there?\n\n4.Why he likes doing evil because as an angel, he was always trying to stop evil? Well why that too only to give it strength, and he even thinks himself to be the only one who can save all the worlds? But now, if he just let the evil do and said nothing more then how the world would be saved from the evil and chaos all over it? He would not be an evil angel now, and he even wants to be such but for some reason, he still wants to remain a bad one, is this logic? Because, he did not have any problem with good, he even was such, but now since he has to face reality in an objective way, he wants his role to be more \"good\" in his eyes?\n\n5.why is his role as angel more fun, he does not have any problem as a villain, just this role of hero is fun for him, and he would also like to be so himself.\n\n6.Why he goes for world conquest in the beginning? Well, I just cannot explain properly there is no flow to this part, could you provide me any link to the explanation? Could we go a bit back? What made him decide to come here? What made him come all this way? What made him look for the world here to conquer? Well, and that too with his powers?\n\n7.Why he does not have any real world friends as he has all these people that are not really his friends, well why is it like that in any way?\n\n8.Why he is happy to become a hero but sad when the day comes that he will have to defend the universe? Why is he this way?\n\n1.) You could say they have come from different countries, but I'm assuming you are only assuming that because of all the historical information that's online.\n\n2.) A bit hard to explain in my opinion, it probably falls back to the 'villain' side of the hero.\n\n3.) You could say that they're friends, but in that case you can be even more vague then.\n\n4.) I honestly have no reference for this one.\n\n5.) I suppose there are any number of possibilities on these, that's the whole point of asking me. I don't know that there is any logic to his actions to do with this, just that they just fall back to the basic definition of the hero.\n\n6.) There is no reason it couldn't have been that way logically, it's just that's what the universe would tell him. There are so many times in the novel when the hero is told when he will have to choose a side, or when he makes his decision, but the hero is so caught up in that process it just falls away.\n\n7. There's no flow to here, just one of his characters stating what happened to the other, which is like the reason why you don't want your main character to be all the same.\n\n8. There is a lot of logic that I don't have and that would make this so much more interesting.\n\nThe most logical flow would be between the first and last sentences in the list.\n\nLet me explain it for anyone who doesn;t understand what I mean...\n\nBiological creatures do not fall in a group. For a simple bacteria species, there is a lot of interdependence in the group but no one actually knows who is in it. And for one of those species who can produce as many bacteria as he needs then he does not know by whom the bacteria are coming, whether from another species, from the environment or even the same strain. And those bacteria get to the end that they can not control", "label": 1, "id": 100723}
{"text": "How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, tell them the story of their life, and the story from all parts of their world \u2013 both good and bad, and then ask them to come and play, live, for three hours? What if the actors are as talented as the best actors we get in film or theatre these days? What if the actors can inhabit their characters like they live them, that we forget we are watching actors?\n\nIt has taken three years to find out. And in the process, we have learned some hard lessons.\n\nOne lesson is that a script can be rewritten. After we had read thousands of pages, it became apparent that only a few words, even at the highest levels of English, had been selected. These were the words that would take you from one page to the next, and let you live the lives in the characters. They were the words that would give the film a story.\n\nA second lesson is that film is never a real documentary, no matter how many of the stories are true. They are filtered through the imagination of film-makers. The words of all those who lived and worked in the past are in the story. It is the truth; yet the films are real. The actors speak as they were led by the story they believed, not as they were told.\n\nWhat had been thought impossible now became possible. For the first time in years we had people coming up to the set after three-hour shoots, not to report how hard it was but to report that those they had just met were living, breathing, and acting as themselves.\n\nA third lesson was about relationships and trust. Everyone who works together \u2013 directors, actors, writers, cameramen, designers \u2013 can, on the whole, trust one another and can always be relied upon. But even the most experienced actors can\u2019t stand each other, no matter how much they love what they are doing.\n\nThe fourth and most important lesson is that as soon as any actor decides to accept an offer to play another person who does not agree to be played, there is no telling where that character ends and that is starts.\n\nThe actors are a family, who come together not only to look after each other in practical but also in emotional ways.\n\nOver the past three and a half years we have all put ourselves at the mercy of the film-makers, and in so doing have shown that the most experienced actor could \u2013 just \u2013 lose, but could not betray, his acting and his integrity.\n\nSo now, the most experienced actors have got together. They have a script \u2013 an outline, actually. They have all had three-hour shoots. And they are ready to play. We have been working with a team of some of the most experienced actors in the world.\n\nSome of them are actors who have never played on screen before. They all know how to handle themselves and how to act.\n\nAnd they are at ease with each other, which is not always the case, as there is no script.\n\nEach has to have an individual set-up, but there is no script to be followed. They are all together on one set, but there is no film crew \u2013 not a sound or a gaffer. It is one film, but no cameras. We have no crew, nothing in the world to help us to make it better\u2026\n\nSo we have worked to improve the existing script we had \u2013 and then developed our own script with new characters, new faces and new problems and conflicts that we had never seen before. We have got so far in the process that we have not yet even seen the original screen.\n\nSo now, the most experienced actors have got together. They have a script \u2013 an outline, actually. They have all had three-hour shoots. And they are ready to play. We have been working with a team of some of the most experienced actors in the world. They have all got their own individual sets. They know each other well. They are always looking out for each other. They work together, but apart.\n\nThe whole of London has been invited. People from film, stage, radio and TV, from London, across the world \u2013 a very small group \u2013 but they come. These are the actors who can inhabit characters for three hours. They can be who they wish to be: brave, heroic, mad, foolish for all that. But even as they live, breathe and act as themselves, they can make them up, as they wish them to be.\n\nThe script is the most important thing. Everyone involved had the script. No one can argue with that, for the script is the foundation of each film, without the script the film would be incomplete.\n\nBut the script also contains the ideas of the writers. For the writers create the story, which, in turn, shapes the script \u2013 and creates the characters we have created.\n\nSo we had", "label": 1, "id": 100724}
{"text": "Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to form metastatic foci in non-sentinel lymph nodes. We have also reported that in a tumor cell line, the T cell growth factor receptor (TCF), the Eph/ephrin protein family of receptors and their associated ligands are essential for mediating metastasis^[@R14]^. Here we report, using the same transgenic mouse, that a small amount of radiation-induced tumor immunity is sufficient for inhibiting metastasis using the same T cell epitope as the tumor vaccine, and that this induction of lymphocyte memory is dependent on local inflammatory changes that occur in the primary tumor environment^[@R15]^.\n\nWe first examined tumor metastases in this mouse model and found that this model had high metastasis rates. In one experiment, we found that tumor metastasis had occurred in 16 out of 20 primary tumors (80%), and that when radiation treatment was administered on the day that tumor cells were injected, then metastatic tumor lesions were found in 9 of 13 mice (69%). However, when we compared mice that underwent only the initial tumor injection/immunization (with or without radiation treatment) to those that received only the immunogen on day 21 post-tumor, metastatic tumor lesions were found in 0 of 15 mice on day 21, compared to 3 of 15 on day 16 ([Extended Data Fig. 1a,b](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This indicates that the small amount of tumor cell killing from the initial immunization (with a low dose of cells or even one immunization) is not sufficient to eradicate cells from the primary tumor, leading to metastasis. Rather, there must be a high number of tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes at the time of the initial immunization/tumor injection to be able to eradicate a metastatic lesion.\n\nIf we consider the hypothesis that radiation can only lead to a subset of cancer cells to die and become dormant, then we can consider that the primary tumor cells may go through a state of 'progression'. One of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they can not only proliferate to generate more cells, but they can also alter their cell-surface receptors to become more resistant to the immune system. For example, cancer cells are known to upregulate anti-apoptotic receptors such as phosphatidylserine (PS), downregulate the Fas receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR) and other immune-related molecules to enable them to evade the immune system^[@R16]^.\n\nSince radiation-induced tumor immunity is dependent on lymphocyte memory, we examined whether the same radiation therapy could lead to lymphocyte memory. A similar irradiation and adoptive transfer method was used to induce immune memory and tumor immunity, and we used a tumor cell line, EL4 thymoma, as the target cell to induce primary lymphocytes for memory studies^[@R17],[@R18]^. The irradiation-induced cancer mouse model had a similar level of lymphocyte recovery two weeks after the irradiation treatment as the other T cell transfer mice ([Extended Data Fig. 1c](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These results indicate that the irradiation was able to induce tumor immunity from the irradiated tumor vaccine with the same T cell epitope (1--6), but not from the same TCR (H-2^b^). These two models were also able to provide protection from tumor metastasis when the mice were challenged with the EL4 tumor cell line two weeks after the irradiation treatment or two weeks after a primary tumor injection through adoptive transfer of lymphocytes ([Fig. 1a-c](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [Extended Data Fig. 2a](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [b](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}), demonstrating that a cell vaccine with the same epitope-specific TCR may elicit tumor-specific lymphocytes. We previously reported that primary tumors from the EL4 tumor cell line in which the TCR had changed into a TCR with a lower affinity (H-2^d^) were highly resistant to rechallenge with tumor cells from the same origin (H-2^d^), although the same tumor cells were not sensitive to immune stimulation^[@R17]^. When we repeated these experiments with EL4 cells, we found that they were also able to induce lymphocytes with memory against the antigen and were resistant to rechallenge ([Extended Data Fig. 2c](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We repeated these assays using tumor vaccine cells transduced with the TCR H-2^b^, and also did not find any resistance to tumor rechallenge ([Extended Data Fig. 3a-d](#F7){ref-type", "label": 1, "id": 100725}
{"text": "background : oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) is extremely rare. The patients often suffer to serious discomfort and loss of normal hearing which make us often avoid surgery to remove oscc without any hope of recovery or survival. We here report our 8 years' experience of performing partial removal surgery of oral squamous cell carcinoma by use of modified radical neck dissection after complete preoperative diagnostic work-up.\n\nCase Presentation\n================\n\nA 46-year-old female was complaining of a lump on her left side of neck. Asymptomatic, she also suffered from hoarseness and sore throat. A biopsy showed oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) without any metastasis. Due to the non-specific symptoms, biopsy was not considered as a definitive diagnostic procedure, but because she lived in a rural environment the physicians who treated her did not use the biopsy results in the diagnostic pathway. The patient was treated with a combination of chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin, and oral docetaxel) and irradiation as well as a combination of surgery (radical neck dissection) and postoperative radiotherapy. During radiotherapy, a left side neck mass appeared and radiotherapy was stopped. After completing radiotherapy she showed no signs of growth of the neck mass. She was considered as having no distant metastasis or cancer extension. Her TNM stage was stage IIB, and the tumor was classified as oscc. She was not given adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. She was followed for four months (February, 2008 to July, 2009) after the initial treatment; we observed no signs of recurrence.\n\nCase\n====\n\nSince June, 2009, we were informed that her head doctor suspected that there was still a small chance of recurrence. She still has no signs of recurrence. We decided to discuss our options with this patient. Since she did not want radical surgery, we decided to conduct a partial radical neck dissection, preserving the parotid and submandibular glands, and reconstructing her left side of face (Figure 1, 2).\n\nFigure 1: Preoperative frontal view of the patient.\n\nFigure 2: Preoperative lateral and postoperative frontal view.\n\nSurgery\n=======\n\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively the operating table was raised and two drains put on the parotid and submandibular glands (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Intraoperative photography of the tumor excised by partial radical neck dissection.\n\nThe skin and the surrounding soft tissue of the neck were prepared with 0.5% chlorhexidine and soaked in an iodine solution.

{"text": "Every \"Garb Day,\" as the triplets call it, they wait by the roadside for the return \"of their Garbs\" (garb? Is it garb? Or are they the people with the garb? They have no idea.)\n\n\"I don't see why they have to come back every day, to be exact. We don't have a problem with it,\" says Mrs. Green, a middle-aged woman wearing a floral headscarf on the morning of the seventh-annual \"garb day.\"\n\nThe triplets have recently become the first members of their town's Muslim community to attend a \"garb day.\"\n\nA recent poll (conducted among Turkish citizens living in the Netherlands) found that 53 percent of them support the wearing of the \"burkini.\" (In English-speaking countries, the term burkini is a term for a swimsuit that fully covers swimsuit-clad part-breasted women.)\n\nAs for the Dutch \"burkini controversy,\" it's a tale that could take years to unravel. A Dutch judge on June 23 placed an indefinite ban on anyone in the Netherlands in possession of a \"burkini,\" which is a reference to the burka, an Islamic-style veil worn by Muslim women in the Middle East. (The ruling cited \"national security reasons.\" The judge didn't explain or justify his decision.)\n\nThe problem with this decision was the lack of evidence for the judge's reason. The problem is the Netherlands now has a ban on the wearing of all burkinis, by all citizens\u2014Muslims and not (for now). This makes the Dutch case at least two thousand times more complicated than the case against the First Amendment and the right of free speech, the right to keep and bear arms, or the right to public assembly.\n\nThe question for the people of the Netherlands is this: Are the \"national security\" reasons for the judge's ruling because the Dutch are Muslim or are the \"national security\" reasons a smokescreen for their being a bunch of racist, Islamophobic Nazis?\n\nAfter all, if a German judge could ban all German neo-Nazis for life\u2014and then call them racists\u2014would it take the national security exception to justify such a decision?\n\nThe problem with the Netherlands case isn't just that there is a debate about the rights of non-Muslims\u2014this isn't the first time that there has been a debate about those of non-Muslims. The problem is the lack of evidence that will justify any ban of the wearing of a burkini in the Netherlands. This will only become clearer as the case unfolds. The problem is in the question: How could the ban have any \"national security\" reason?\n\nTo be fair, The Hague has always had a history of restricting the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms. But what about an issue that has gone unsolved for a century?\n\nThe case of the First Amendment of the Constitution was settled the early 1900s, in a dispute over a tax. The First Amendment states: \"Congress shall makeNo law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nAnd then the famous \"case\" was filed in federal court in New York Supreme Court. A baker refused to give a baker's dozen of a man's wedding cakes to the man's daughter. As a citizen, the woman would have been able to carry the cakes to the baker in the town where the wedding was held and buy them. The judge ruled in her favor. He then ruled that \"a federal court cannot declare as unconstitutional a state law which does not conflict with the [federal] Constitution.\" The baker refused to comply with the judge's ruling, and he sued.\n\nThe Second Amendment is the right of a citizen to \"keep and bear arms.\" The judge in that case didn't rule in favor of the citizen, but he did decide that the state law had no conflict with the Constitution. But, in fact, the judge was ignoring the First Amendment. The judge had ruled that in a \"free society\" the Second Amendment's ban on the manufacture and sale of guns in the U.S. didn't apply to the citizens who own their own guns. He then ruled that it meant that in a free society no one in America could keep and bear arms.\n\nIn other words, the judge ignored the word \"Free\" in \"free society,\" to state that a citizen (or a government) can't own a gun.\n\nHowever, that case\u2014called District of Columbia v. Heller, in 2013\u2014didn't prove that there is a right to keep and bear arms. It proved that the government had the right to deny gun owners their Second Amendment right to a gun.

{"text": "we explore the possible tie between the naturalness of having a child and having children.\n\nThe naturalness of having a child.\n\nLet\u2019s start by considering the most general aspect of naturalness: to what extent being born without one\u2019s parents is natural.* First of all, we can\u2019t take any such notion as a standard: it is not a stable individual characteristic, it is a process. The child is born and dies as an individual human being. In terms of any standard individual characteristic (say, height), there is plenty of room for other people. All people are human beings and we have to accept that. We don\u2019t have to adopt a universal view on having a child. Having children is not a standard characteristic that we have to \u201cstandardize\u201d. We should be in agreement on the definition of \u2018having children\u2019 \u2013 even if there are many variations in definitions in various cultures.\n\nSo, in this aspect, there is no need to accept a universail standard to which we should have to \u201cstandardize\u201d.\n\nIn the second aspect, the person who was born in the absence of his/her parents is an independent human being who is not (at least so far as he/she is able to recognize and act upon) attached to the parents. This independence is a result of the biological and social mechanisms responsible for making him/her a human being. The parents are the natural environment in which their son/daughter has to grow \u2013 it is a complex, inter-related process that takes into account the child\u2019s biological predispositions as well as the environment, society, etc., in which the parents live. We are born into a complex, interrelated social system. That\u2019s the second aspect of naturalness: the process is non-trivial, non-arbitrary, not predetermined. It is not a fact that we can \u201cjust\u201d decide to accept or reject certain types of people as parents without being in the process of a long and complicated process, without first being able to understand and then accept the process. It is an interaction between the genetic and environmental processes. So, this person is not a victim of circumstances or bad luck.\n\nIn the third aspect, there is the sense in which it is not easy to say that a person is a victim of circumstances and bad luck. Consider a situation in which there are two parents, one has been born blind, one is disabled and the disabled one is not considered beautiful. In such a situation, one could say that the disabled child should not be born; a mother could say the same about a disabled child born with no legs; one could assert that the disabled child is a victim of circumstances and bad luck, the other could argue that the disabled child can learn to cope with the situation. So, when we think something is the result of bad luck it is because someone is trying to convince us that this is so. Bad luck is understood in such a way, whereas in the case of people who have been born blind or deaf, bad luck is something different. We are used to thinking of bad luck as the result of bad judgement, which is also how we think of all other accidents or misfortunes. In the case of someone who was born blind, you are trying to convince yourself that he/she was not able to take advantage of the good opportunities in life. You are not so much trying to convince yourself that his/her life was \u201cbad\u201d or that bad luck played a role. You are trying to convince yourself that bad luck (with respect to the child) played a role in bad judgement.\n\nThis is a different way of thinking. The fact that someone has been born disabled doesn\u2019t mean that the parent didn\u2019t have a chance in life. They were able to learn the skills of a normal human being without any difficulty. You can argue, then, that one person should not be born blind and another person should not be born deaf. But there is a big difference between the two examples: in the first example, the disabled person doesn\u2019t have a right to life. He/she has a chance to a normal human life and, if he/she is not happy, there is no point in making him/her live a \u201cperfect\u201d life in which circumstances are not at play. The second example is the opposite: the disabled child has in his/her existence no right to life whatsoever. The child never had a right to a normal life \u2013 what right did the child have to live free of disease, in what way could the child have taken advantage of the right to a normal life? What right did the child have to live as you and I live? This is an interesting point. Can we say that there are circumstances in life that we have to \u201caccept\u201d, the circumstances in which we have to live, so", "label": 1, "id": 100731}

Soon I was sitting in the dark in the small theater, with a cigarette sticking out of my lower lip.\n\nI remember staring out of the dark at the dark theater, wondering how everyone came here to see this film I was sitting in.\n\nA man came in with two seats on a dolly and began to lower the seats. He worked slowly, methodically, as if he didn\u2019t want to scare us\u2014even though no one was afraid of anything.\n\nOnce in, we all went back the way we came.\n\nThe movie seemed like John Cassavetes\u2019 most successful movie. It has all the ingredients. It begins in San Francisco, and then we go north, south and east.\n\nAfter the first half hour, everyone seemed to fall into the rhythm of the movie, but I sat there, not believing everything I was seeing. The film is funny and tender and sad at the same time.\n\nEventually the story began moving in a direction I had never expected.\n\nThere are not many films that use the first-person experience to the fullest extent. \u201cA Woman Under the Influence\u201d is one of them. The feeling of the characters as people you know is so good that when it ended I found myself in tears. I also remembered that I hadn\u2019t cried in a long time, and it hadn\u2019t helped me much with my job, so I couldn\u2019t exactly blame that thing on film.\n\nFor years people would talk about how great \u201cA Woman Under the Influence\u201d was, and I remember telling everyone how much I thought it was great. So you can imagine how surprised I was when I picked up the Sunday newspaper and saw the name of my favorite John Cassavetes film at the bottom.\n\nI didn\u2019t read it immediately, but I didn\u2019t want to miss it either.\n\nI finally did read the letter.

I wish I could have seen it, because the script is so clever and it had such a good ending.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve often wondered, though, if there was an actual movie out there about what happened to this woman in this way?\n\nI think she was a bit confused. I believe she was trying to get to the San Francisco set, the Hollywood set, and then the real Los Angeles set. It was her ambition. She wanted to be a star. She even wanted to be a movie star.\n\nShe didn\u2019t succeed, or wasn\u2019t happy, or got sick and died, and in a way I am grateful that the real film came along and showed how many of her dreams went unfulfilled.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought of \u201cA Woman Under the Influence\u201d as a portrait of a woman trying to become a star, but not succeeding.\n\nI\u2019m glad the real woman didn\u2019t become a movie star because a real movie star would be just as unhappy.\n\nJohn Cassavetes had some good films, though. I\u2019ve thought about him a lot. When I go see a film by John Cassavetes, it\u2019s like reading a book by a book author. In the words of Jack London, \u201cA book by a dead poet.\u201d\n\nWhen somebody dies, when you look over his or her body and you see the life behind the life, you forget about the words.\n\nIn the case of William Henry Chase and the life, \u201cA Woman Under the Influence\u201d still gives people the chance to laugh a lot.\n\nI\u2019ve seen so many people laugh in the movie\u2014even though it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s also sad for me, though, because I remember when Cassavetes thought that film was going to be so amazing.\n\nEveryone loved the movie at the time, but it never got made. Many movie people saw John Cassavetes, but they didn\u2019t see \u201cA Woman Under the Influence.\u201d\n\nYou can bet I\u2019ll be sitting at the back of the theater on opening night.\n\n\u2014\n\nI\u2019ve watched it almost six times.

{"text": "imaging in the restframe ultraviolet has proven to be an extremely powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, and for the very first time, we can study the Lyman Break systems in the restframe UV continuum at high redshifts. First studies in this wavelength range have focused on finding and measuring galaxies and Lyman Break candidates by directly subtracting their expected Lyman alpha forest [Ly$\\alpha $\\;]{}\u00a0forecasts (e.g., @shapley01; @hayes01 [@pettini02]; @adelberger03 [@adelberger04]; @stark06). Unfortunately, these UV continuum imaging results are of low contrast (e.g., @shapley01). We will see that this contrast increases significantly when the Lyman Break systems are considered in their entirety.\n\nWe focus on the restframe UV continuum imaging that has been done in this wavelength range [@stark06], with observations being performed by the MMT and the WHT, utilizing the same multi-object spectrographs and the same CCDs. @stark06 use their data to image spectroscopically selected Lyman Break candidates with Lyman Break Imaging using a slit of 30 (or 120) from the MMT, and also images spectroscopically selected Lyman Break candidates with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 which covers a much larger wavelength interval. The spectrographs that were used on the WHT and the MMT are described in @cooke96. We chose WFPC2 to probe into the restframe UV continuum for the following reasons: (1) HST has better spatial resolution and sensitivity than ground-based CCDs can deliver; (2) most of our Lyman Break candidates were detected by HST and the ground-based telescope can also help us to characterize the morphology, kinematics and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. The final three images in our study have been published in @stark06. Of the three spectroscopic samples, the second (WHT) sample has the least reliable S/N because they did not have enough time on the HST to cover all of the possible regions in the field of the galaxy down to their desired depth, i.e., 60\u00a0\u2013 90 mag. The third (MMT) sample has S/N and the highest redshift in their sample, so it is the best possible combination for measuring the restframe UV continuum. We note that the galaxies covered by both HST and ground-based optical spectrographs can vary greatly due to variations in stellar population, age, and extinction (see @stark06).\n\nIn the current studies, the continuum images have been constructed from the measured flux in the $R$ and $I$ band, and the broad-band photometry comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: @york00 [@beers90; @stoughton92]). In [\u00a7\\[sec\\_spectra\\]]{}, we will describe the broad-band photometry, and then explore the various possible continuum images in the restframe UV continuum in [\u00a7\\[sec\\_compare\\]]{}. In this paper, a complete Lyman Break system with all four colors in the restframe UV continuum is a new result; the first to be published in the literature.\n\nLyman Break Candidates and Selection Techniques {#sec_sel}\n===============================================\n\nWe will present three types of Lyman Break candidates and their associated continuum photometric selections. First is the Lyman Break candidates that we are directly comparing with the Ly$\\alpha$ predicted spectra. In this case, we can compare the Ly$\\alpha$ and Lyman Break predictions directly. These galaxies are not necessarily associated with the Lyman Break galaxies because the Ly$\\alpha$ emission is from very young stars that contribute to the Lyman Break population without the Lyc emission. For the purpose of measuring and comparing the two Lyman Break systems, we have selected only one of the colors, $M > -18$, (see Fig.\u00a01) as a threshold for our analysis, because it allows for a simple comparison as is presented in [\u00a7\\[sec\\_compare\\]]{}. In other words, we are choosing the $M > -18$ selection as both galaxies are dominated by the Lyman Break luminosity so that we will have sufficient counts to analyze their restframe UV continuum without the contamination from [Ly$\\alpha$\u00a0]{}\u00a0emission from young Lyman Limit systems. The restframe UV selection also yields many additional selection criteria without having to be biased by Lyman Break absorption features as they are the result of strong line-absorption of H I along the line of sight.\n\nA second type of Lyman Break system we can", "label": 1, "id": 100733}
{"text": "Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some areas of the world, including the Bahamas. They are often found in coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ctenophores are an ancient order of animals.\n\nThe earliest fossil ctenophore is a 3-millimeter-long crustacean called Auloposeidon from the Kimmeridgian Period in the Devonian era in North America. These large animals would have covered themselves with spines and fangs as a defense mechanism against predators. This primitive life form is considered a major transitional animal from one stage to the next evolutionary step.\n\nA Ctenophysoidea is a ctenophore with four eyes on each side of the head. The ctenophore's tentacles are very long and curved. The color of a ctenophore is often purple. Ctenophores sometimes use their tentacles to attach themselves to surfaces, such as rocks and corals. Ctenophores use various methods of motion to capture prey such as with their tentacle contractions, the rhythmic muscular contractions of the head and tentacles.\n\nCtenophores use their tentacles to trap small prey or to attach. When the victim is small enough, the ctenophore folds its tentacle around it and closes its mouth, locking the seal with one tentacle and then the other, creating a partial vacuum and preventing escape. When the prey escapes, the ctenophore opens its wide mouth and throws the prey into its stomach to be digested. Ctenophores also use a variety of chemicals to immobilize their prey and induce fear in prey and prey predators. This process is known as pufferoo, in which the ctenophore spares its prey and is then preyed on by a pufferfish or a squid, which is known as a puffer. Ctenophores can kill, but usually only when caught in a net.\n\nA Ctenophore does not have any true legs. Its legs are short in form which increases its swimming speed. It also has a flexible foot that is not attached to a single segment, allowing the animal to move more easily in shallow water and in the dark. The animal's eyes and tentacles give it depth perception.\n\nCtenophore is a member of a vertebrate group known as Bilateria, which includes all the fish, the sharks and the cephalopods. Ctenophores are the only known exception to the rule that vertebrates are all bilaterian animals. The largest ctenophore, known as the blue-spotted jellyfish (Calyptra planorbis), can reach up to 4 m in length, while a common Caribbean jellyfish, the Caribbean goby (Eulamprus quoyi) can reach as much as 18 m. However, they usually only grow between 3 m and several m in length.\n\nA small number of Ctenophores, the Heterotrachodontid ctenophores, are known to be capable of self-medicating and may use this ability as a defense mechanism when threatened. This ability is also known as a \"behavioral defense\u201c. Self-medicating animals are usually poisonous, but some are less toxic than others. It is difficult to determine which organism is actually doing the self-medicating and it may be a camouflage behavior, or may simply be a response to the presence of another, more toxic organism.[citation needed]\n\nCtenophores make up about 10% of all animal taxa, and are diverse in their distribution. About 4,250 species, most belonging to 5 genera, are currently described, but some, as many as 2,000 species, are yet undescribed. The Ctenophore order makes up the majority of ctenophores in the world, representing 40% of the total number of marine invertebrate species. Species of Ctenophore include a wide variety of shapes and colors and range in size.\n\nThe largest Ctenophore is the blue-spotted jellyfish, the largest animal at 5.88 m (20 ft) tall. Some smaller species include a red-spotted ctenophore (Cyrtopodium euxenii) which can be up to 1.8 m long and is found in shallow water in tropical areas, and a yellow-spotted ctenophore (Hydrobia ulvae) which is about 3 \u2013 4 m long and has a wide mouth. They produce a thick orange goo when they die. Some of the smallest ctenophore is the green ctenophore.\n\nThe life span of ctenophores ranges from a few months to 1-3 years, depending primarily on the species. Most live in shallow waters.

{"text": "we study the dynamic behaviour of a quantum two - dimensional system - one of them is classical (Euler-Poisson constraint) and one is quantum - in order to find their dynamic stability properties under perturbations and how far they will go. We will show that both classical and quantum models are dynamically unstable. We study a model quantum with only attractive nonlinearity and linear spring constant (\\[euler\\]) and find that it is statically stable. The same is true for a second model, quantum with repulsive nonlinearity and linear spring constant (\\[rep\\]), which is also dynamically stable for the first perturbation order. For the third, classical model, the first two perturbation orders are considered and it is seen to be dynamically unstable. In the first case we do not deal with any repulsive terms (\\[epr\\],\\[repp\\]) in the nonlinear potential (\\[nli\\]) and in the second cases we add repulsive terms in the potentials (\\[repk\\],\\[rep\\]).\n\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In section 2 we introduce the physical systems we will deal with. In section 3 we derive the system of equations of motion and their solutions, including the perturbations. In particular we study the solutions of some exact equations corresponding to the classical and quantum models, and the perturbations of them. In section 4 we apply our method of solving equations of motion to these models and find their dynamical behaviour both for the classical and quantum systems. Conclusions are summarized in section 5.\n\nPhysical systems and equations of motion\n========================================\n\nWe will assume that the system we study is a classical (or quantum) model of nonlinear harmonic oscillator, i.e. equation of motion for a quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$ moving in the one - dimensional classical system. The classical system of one - dimensional harmonic oscillator (considered as a perturbation) is described by the following equation of motion $$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=K_x=\\frac{dx}{dt}\\left( \\frac{\\Gamma\nx^3}{1+\\Gamma x^4}-3x^2\\right),  \\label{oscillx}$$ where, here and through the whole paper, $x$ is the displacement of the particle along the direction of motion $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $t$ is the time.\n\nAn alternative model of one - dimensional classical system is given by a second order Hamiltonian (or nonlinear) partial differential equation of motion where the nonlinearity comes from the kinetic energy (\\[oscillx\\]), $$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+K_{x}\\frac{x}{(1+y)}=0.    \\label{oscilly}$$ Here $y=\\frac{dx}{dt}$ is also a function of $t$ (the Lagrangian coordinate and hence the Hamiltonian) satisfying the first order partial differential equation: $$\\frac{dy}{dt}+K_{y}=0=\\frac{dy}{dt}\\frac{\\eta ^3}{1+\\eta\n^{4}}-3y^2,   \\label{oscilly1}$$ where $\\eta \\left( t\\right) =\\frac{\\Gamma x}{(1+\\Gamma x^2)}-1\n\\;$ and $\\;y(t)       $, its derivative. The function $x(t)$ satisfies equation of motion (\\[oscillx\\]) and $\\;y(t)$ satisfies (\\[oscilly\\]) with $\\eta =1$.\n\nIt is usual to study the behaviour of solutions of equations (\\[oscillx\\],\\[oscilly1\\]). One of the most simple and general way to do it is to linearize them about a fixed and chosen reference trajectory [@kol1; @kul]. In order to do this one needs the Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) $L=\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{x} ^2\\gamma _{1}(x)+u$ with $\\; \\gamma _{1}(x)=1+2\\sqrt{1+\\left( x-p\\right)}$ where $x$ is the coordinate along the classical trajectory, $p$ is the canonical momentum and $u$ is the Lagrangian kinetic energy, where $p$ and $u$ are considered as independent variables.

Material and Device\n=======================\n\n[Figure 1](#f1-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the basic concept of the two-step procedure of material and device design. In practice, the material is the active component of a device and the device is its active component. In a conventional device, the material is the active component. The basic architecture or structure of a mechanical device is illustrated in [Figure 2](#f2-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"}. A mechanical device comprises a lever, a fulcrum, and the arm and is generally symmetric with respect to the axis of rotation. The fundamental and primary role of the mechanical device is to enable a certain action to be performed, which consists in the movement of (a) the arm in relation to (b) the fulcrum in such a manner to affect a change in some value of the system of coordinates. In addition to the fundamental role of the lever, the basic structure of the device includes the fulcrum that supports the arm. The basic role of the fulcrum is to prevent the movement of the arm in the forward or backward direction because if the arm is allowed to reverse its direction, the system of coordinates will change in such a manner that the initial set of values of the variables describing a state of the system will change, and this will be contrary to the nature of the system in question. The system of coordinates will continue to change as long as the arm continues to move in the forward or backward direction. Any attempt to reverse the direction of the arm will cause the arm to move on to such a position that it is now at such a distance from the fulcrum that it will not be able to perform the desired action because it will no longer be able to cause the required change in the values of two or more vectors belonging to the system of coordinates. Hence, the arm has a limited working range and the design of the device that enables the arm to move in the forward or backward direction requires the development of the device so that the working range of that arm is not changed as the arm moves against the fulcrum from position to position. If the arm is given a positive, constant velocity, it will perform the desired action in the forward direction as much as possible; however, the arm will not be able to move into the backward position that is required if the velocity of the arm is reversed.\n\nAnalogous to the function of the lever, the action of the arm and fulcrum will usually be such that movement in the direction orthogonal to that direction produces an increase in a certain property of a system being defined. The system of coordinates in the system of axes (*x*,*y*,*z*) will have a value *x*\u2032, *y*\u2032, or *z*\u2032 at the point of origin on the side of the origin corresponding to axis *z*\u2032, the line *z* = constant. The system of coordinates in other two axes will vary depending on the value of the *x* and *y*. The three properties that result from the movement of an individual point in the *x*, *y* or *z* axis in relation to the value *z* = constant are: (i) the distance is increased, (*ii*) the orientation of the line joining this point to the origin point is altered, and (*iii*) the angle by which the line joins the origin point and the *z* axis is altered. In the three-dimensional space that is bounded by the four sides corresponding to the sides of the cube with the side corresponding to three axes (*z*, *x*, *y*), the change in the values of the components in a system of coordinates will occur along an arc joining the point with the origin to the point opposite to the *z* axis, the line *z* = constant. The angle between two axes will increase with the increase and decrease in the values of the variables along the arc.\n\nThe action of the two-dimensional movement of the arm and the orientation of the arm will form an image of the position of the arm along the *z* axis as shown in [Figure 1](#f1-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"}. In the process of scanning the *z* axis, the *z* axis needs to be scanned at some degree of inclination such that as the *z* axis is scanned from a fixed scanning range along the *z* axis, the", "label": 1, "id": 100738}

The hardest thing to live with is the self-hate it causes.\n\nI was so proud to be an infantryman. They called us the hard men of the world. The Marines were tough. In many ways we were tough, but we were not tougher. We were also soft and soft like children, and we hated ourselves for it.\n\nWe thought we were always right and we were always right and we were forever right, and we believed we were better than the world and all its people. Our lives were like a dream and the only reality was the one God had given us in the form of our training and service.\n\nThe trouble was we didn't understand what it was to be truly alive. We thought we were still in an ideal scenario, where there was no real pain, just an ideal pain to overcome. We didn't understand that pain was real even to the person who didn't even know it. We could suffer in our idealistic dreams, but when we woke up, the misery was still there. The pain was not just an idea in the future. It was the reality of what we had made of ourselves. We lived in a dream that was also our reality; our reality became our fantasy.\n\nIt was as if we were really living in the first chapter of the book of Genesis, where the Lord said, \"Behold, the man has become like one of Us, but I have not found him.\" (Genesis 3:19) We really thought we were the one who would know and see clearly His face.\n\nI tried to remember God's face. I tried to remember the face of God. I tried so hard to make sense of my life, my circumstances, but what I could remember most was the face of Satan.\n\nAs a child I was always a little scared of Satan. He was the biggest, meanest, most evil being in my universe. I thought of him as a sort of God; he was like God on top of the Mount of Transfiguration.\n\nAs I grew into the Marines, I thought of Satan as a great captain of an ugly, giant, evil company of soldiers with their funny little haircuts and funny little dog. I knew better than to get on Satan's level, but I never quite figured out how to do that. He was always talking about us. He would say, \"This is the toughest of the tough. That's not the real tough. This is the real tough. You don't understand.\"\n\nWe were always the tough part. We were always first, and always going to be last. We made our lives easy and we didn't make life easy for each other. On the downside it meant we fought more. We died more. We were not the most moral company. But we had always had enough to keep each other happy and make life tolerable in the service.\n\nA lot of people would say, \"I'm so ashamed of what I did. I didn't know. I should have stopped at home. I should have had some sense, but sometimes things just happen. I should have had some sense, but sometimes things just happen.\" That's a human excuse. And it's a lot of excuses.\n\nWhat's more, it's a lot of excuses because most Christians have become so comfortable in their sin that they are numb to its realities. I remember in our training on the day our platoon was selected for a combat tour, I was so sick of listening to the drill sergeants when they told us it would be a three-month tour\u2014three times longer than we deserved\u2014that I stood up, looked the sergeants straight in the eyes and asked, \"Do you have any idea how much I want to go and be a combat commander?

But if you want me to sit here and listen to the drill sergeants talk\u2014that's what I'm going to do.\" Those sergeants were scared, and I was sick of listening to their fear. I wasn't going to sit here and listen to any more fear.\n\nMy desire to be a combat-kicker meant my desire to be a leader. It forced a confrontation with the fear that had been a part of us from the beginning.\n\nOne night the senior drill sergeant took me aside to talk to me.

{"text": "Laminated sheets give instructions for using the materials in the teaching module of the new course.\n\nIn the new course, materials are given only for a limited period of time (e.g., one credit-hour or 45 minutes in a 5-hour classroom period) and do not go beyond the point at which the student is certified. This feature enables you to evaluate the material offered in a given class from the student's perspective. This way, you can assess the effectiveness of a teaching module or, after your evaluation, develop a new teaching module.\n\nThe new class is taught only in the classroom setting. Therefore, as well as teaching in the computer lab and library, the students receive instruction in the classroom (as a form of the library lecture). This means that if the new course were taught outside the classroom, many of the materials would have to be prepared in advance.\n\nThe new class is only taught in the classroom setting. Because the students do not receive instruction outside the class time period, there may not be a good deal of time in which to develop their learning and practicing skills. Consequently, as well as preparing a new course, you should give the students a substantial amount of time to practice the new course in the classroom.\n\n**Using materials in a new course**\n\nIf you decide to use the materials in the new course in a different way or manner than was originally envisioned, you must make the changes in your syllabus and assignment instructions carefully, including the new changes in the list of materials, the description of the material, the format and frequency of the activities (e.g., make sure there is sufficient time within the class time frame), and the assessment of the material.\n\nAs you develop this new course, you will want to consider how to make the course activities different from the previous version of the course. If you can change the materials and activities substantially (without changing the assessment), this can improve the effectiveness of the new course. After you put the materials into a new format, consider developing a few new activities that can be performed during the class time frame (for example, at the start of the class time frame). Try to find activities that will be fun and require the students to participate actively.\n\nThis is not a time to start over with an entirely new approach. Remember that although you may be redesigning several aspects of the course, it will take time to produce the materials and to develop the activities. It is critical that you take time and a few days to plan, evaluate, and then develop a new course.\n\n**Learning and practice**\n\nMany of the learning and practice strategies suggested in this chapter can be used in the new course. First, be sure to take time to learn and practice the new approach that you are developing and then, after this work, develop new activities for the new course.\n\nIf you decide to use the same materials and activities for a few new activities that are similar to those used in the previous course, these practices can then be used to create a new course with a different approach.\n\n**The syllabus**\n\nThe final step in developing the new course is to develop a syllabus consistent with the new course and that explains clearly and clearly defines its objectives (both short-term and long-term). The syllabus must be written clearly and concisely so that students can write and reference the syllabus. The syllabus should be organized and developed so that a student can develop a self-contained knowledge (rather than a knowledge that is built on concepts or principles).\n\nOnce a syllabus has been developed, assign the course to one or more students as homework. The syllabus is designed to assist the students and not to provide a curriculum for every student to follow.\n\n**Assigning homework**\n\nIn general, the homework assignment list should be divided by instructional time into three types of assignments: (1) readings for the students; (2) group work; and (3) exams. It is good practice to plan assignments this way: for example, each assignment in the first month (reading and group work) or week (exams). As homework assignments are developed, the instructor may use a check list that allows students to complete each one of the assignments. This checklist should include the following elements:\n\n\u2022 the assignment to be given to the student;\n\n\u2022 the type of assignment, including how to mark the student's work;\n\n\u2022 the name and telephone number of the instructor or someone who is qualified to teach the course;\n\n\u2022 instructions on how to complete the assignment;\n\n\u2022 a set of suggested practice activities (for example, note taking, problem-solving, problem-solving in groups, presentations, discussion;\n\n\u2022 the grade that is expected for each assignment that is not provided by gradebook (see Section 2.2.3);\n\n\u2022 the expected time within the class time frame.\n\nFor", "label": 1, "id": 100741}

{"text": "Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a character in a series with like, hundreds of characters is one thing. Being told your character just got caught up into something far bigger than you is quite another.\n\nBut hey, even the first issue of a series can be interesting. A character's life could be worth exploring. And the first issue is one of the most engaging in this franchise.\n\nWhat about the creative team? The cast and the writers must be the ones who made this book what she is. So is it a matter of talent and timing or what?\n\nSomeday, you will have so many good writers and so many good people working for you that you can't tell who wrote what. Then you will be in need of a secretary, and someone will have to explain all those emails you receive.\n\nAnd then you will go on to have a wonderful assistant who will be more than capable of typing up all those emails and then go off to type up a new letter to everyone, and then you will be able to type up those emails while everyone sleeps in their beds, and so on and so forth.\n\nI think this has something to do with the creator of this series not having as much creative input as he should, given how popular and well received and well thought out this series is. Even if he had more of a hand in writing some of these stories it is impossible to be in any position to control who is accepted as the storyteller and who is the storyteller's writer.\n\nThe books are not well written. The quality of the artwork is inconsistent. The characters are underused or used for very little. The story telling skills of most of the writers are mediocre at best. The voice of the characters range from the incredibly generic to the utterly bizarre. At least two of the main characters are the most reprehensible characters in the history of superheroes because of their actions.\n\nWhile this might make for fun reading for some because it's very much not a story that gets anyone to be depressed, it's pretty much the reason why the first issue of a comic was not a success.\n\nAlso, not even the creators are allowed to tell who wrote just one character (except the creator of that character) and they do not have to tell you themselves when they do. Even the creator of the main character makes no attempt to defend his actions other than to say how his actions were misguided and how he does not regret his decisions. Why? It just does not make any effort to find out the author name, how the character is defined or any information about the character's background. It just goes straight to action.\n\nThere is no character development or any effort at all to build this series because that is not a priority at DC and it's not important at Marvel either.\n\nWhich isn't to say that that is a bad thing. The writing, the art, the dialogue and the storytelling is very good. The characters even have some quirks that made me laugh out loud. The story is not at all bad. It's just not as good. In fact, in my opinion the art is slightly better because when I noticed the issue number, I was surprised to see I was getting 12 issues. So I figured I would have only just one more issue to go, but I was completely wrong. It's not just the art, it's everything else.\n\nAt least with other new IPs the creator of these characters does not even have to justify himself. The writers must already know who wrote what and why and when they start, so when they come to finish one more issue, they won't have to justify themselves with excuses and explanations, but with a story, character development and character evolution.\n\nIf there's one thing that Marvel has going against them it's this issue is this character.\n\nYou're forgetting one thing.\n\nThe only way that you, or anyone for that matter could tell who wrote which other character is a) They just do not take the time to find out whose writing skills match theirs, and b) in the case of an event with multiple creators, then the writers have to be assigned to one-by-one, where as a team all working on a single character would have at least some chance of finding out who was the one responsible.\n\nWe have been getting this sort of thing for 5 years now. The writers who wrote the Avengers know and admit who wrote what but say never once did they mention it and the only time they're even hinting that they might be responsible for that character is when they're writing it in an interview. At least they have a chance to get some input, at least they have to acknowledge in some way what went into it and what the reason for it was.\n\nI have read almost all of the X-books (or some of them anyway) and even though I enjoy the individual stories, I just can't get this one out of", "label": 1, "id": 100743}

{"text": "I've just watched Fingersmith, and I'm stunned to see the lack of any of the \"old school\" elements that fans remember. Not sure what I'm watching as the quality of the graphics? The music? Or the acting?\n\nThe biggest difference, I think, is the graphics. But it's not just on the graphics, either. The characters look like they're from a different video game, all of them--all except for the one in the back with the helmet on. For some reason I can't get over the lack of a weapon on the other guy.\n\nThe acting is pretty bad. In fact, it's good that I'm watching it with the subtitles because some of the things the characters do sounds very strange. In one case they're being called by a name. Is there any way they're saying 'Mort'? Not likely, but it might be from the \"MORT\" part in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nIn another case, someone has a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. I don't know how they do that, I'd like to know. And, on a related note, what the hell was that thing? I guess I have no clue either, but I was sort of hoping to be enlightened about that by playing the game myself (or at least get an idea).\n\nI'm really starting to hate this game now. The graphics seem very low quality, the editing seems a bit amateurish, and the voice acting is not believable at all.\n\nI can't understand how this game was put together. From the very first scene I've always been intrigued about the concept and I think it will probably end up being a very good game - but as I've seen nothing to date (I didn't play the 360 version) I'd love to know how it was originally developed.\n\nI was expecting something quite different. I really like how you're able to take advantage of the console controls and the \"camera view\"- where you can literally shoot and use weapons to destroy all the enemies - and you have to go through a bunch of random rooms. It seems to me that a lot of developers don't bother with the \"camera view\" option- a lot of the controls are not all that intuitive, and it definitely is at the point where it's very hard to move around with the D-pad and keep the camera view in mind.\n\nI also like that you can \"move\" your character around to see some of the rooms and the areas through all of them, so it isn't just \"a room with a shotgun\" or \"a room with a pistol\".\n\nAnd the graphics-- I don't even want to talk about \"bad\".\n\nI think it will be a good game, but please do not rush something that will take a very long time to become a game.\n\nWhen I first heard about Fingersmith,I was a bit puzzled as to how it was put together. I mean the people who came up with this concept sounded like they were from a different universe.I mean it doesn't make sense as far as the setting goes and the story. But then I looked through it... the story goes on like this....the girl is running as fast as she can down a dark alley after somebody has shot at her and she ends up in this futuristic town only to lose the key and be forced to run and run and run...then she comes across this town's only doctor and he takes all of her medical needs for the night and she is forced to just give him some money so he will take care of any medical issues that arise,that she may ever face and he gives her some cash which he says she can take because she is \"running out\".So he took some of her money which she did not know about when the doctor told her he was going on a trip for the night.He then gives her a key to a town and a gun to a town of robots...\nOn top of that,the story goes on like this...a doctor...a robot...the town...a girl...a key...a doctor.I really do not know why this person decided to make something like this. This is just a bad idea... I would rather play a game with actual story and characters like a game like FarCry which I'm told really is very good. So, no story on this game for me. Just go shoot everything... and go look for a key... The game is called Fingersmith I believe and the story goes on like this.And the gameplay is just like FarCry.. you go through the different areas in each room (i.e. hospital, town, robot village) and then you try to kill all the people in that area.I don' t know if I should be frustrated or really enjoying it...\n\nthe voice acting is way to good for this game. it gives me a headache\n\nwhen i played as the doctor...he was not", "label": 1, "id": 100746}
{"text": "Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that in the days of the Hebrews an empire was created but that it was small and a series of independent empires that grew from it into something more than a small monarchy.\n\nThis interpretation seems somewhat problematic since it contradicts what we know from archaeological findings. According to excavations at Tel Megiddo some of the city's population may have lived in a more primitive way of life than the people of the surrounding land. Tel Megiddo was an important urban center in the 6th Dynasty, and may have served as its capital. Megiddo may well have belonged to a network of cities that made it an important cultural center, that was of a much higher caliber than Tel Dan. Furthermore, the presence of a number of large pottery jars along the shores of the Dead Sea, dating to the 6th or 7th Dynasty, indicates the existence of an urban population who cultivated the necessary plants for their diet. One could argue that the urban center itself became the empire of the time. Indeed, the ancient records of the time clearly mention many independent cities, such as Megiddo, Baalbek, Hazor, Jerusalem, and Gath.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty we encounter one of the key developments of early Egyptian history, the appearance of a new city-state, the capital of the empire. In the 6th dynasty, there was a great change in the political landscape in Egypt. For the first time we see cities become part of the political landscape. These cities not only had to compete for resources, but the city states needed to provide infrastructure to carry out their economy. At the same time, the state needed to establish an image of strength and power.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty we can see both the appearance of a new imperial culture among the cities, and the establishment of new types of structures on a large scale, which included the large buildings, as well as the temples. The temples played a great role in supporting the economy; they served as places for social rituals that produced economic benefits by the social interaction taking place among the citizens. The large temples were an important part of this religious culture, and became increasingly important places of the building. They were used to support local religious activities and to produce income for the priests.\n\nAlthough the role of temples in the process of the construction of a new political and cultural order for Egyptian cities may seem contradictory, the evidence clearly suggests that the cities in the 6th Dynasty used their temples as building tools. The large temples were seen as very important places where the public could find their place. They were also used as places where the government could exercise its authority. The temples were important tools for Egyptian cities in order to change their environment, and they were used to construct an image for this change and their new image as city states.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty, a number of large cities are documented, and they come to dominate the political landscape of the country. It is reasonable to conclude that one of the goals of the early Egyptian kings was to use these large capitals as tools, in order to support their economic growth. But the cities did not only have to provide large areas for the production of resources for the economic benefit of the people of the region. Also important were the large-scale construction of houses and buildings, which were important parts of the political ideology and life of the Egyptian people. The temples were the center of all these projects and activities.\n\nThese large-scale construction projects were a powerful symbol of the dominance of the central government in cities across the country, leading Egypt to become more centralized than ever before. In the 6th Dynasty, the urban centers became more powerful, and became a tool for the support of the larger political economy and the social structure of a nation.\n\nThe 6th Dynasty of Egypt produced some of the most powerful rulers in history. In the 5th Dynasty we see an example of a family that had the political initiative to produce the great Rameses II. According to Herodotus (I, p. 1078), his father was a priest, and his mother's father was of royal blood, making him a member of the priestly caste. But his power and charisma are more obvious from the fact that he is seen as the conqueror of some of the most important cities of the time, such as Cairo and Memphis. By establishing a cult to himself, he was both revered and feared.\n\nThe temple at the main sanctuary at Heliopolis, which was probably built by Rameses, is important because it marks the beginning of royal construction on a grand scale. The great temple at Heliopolis, which was built as an homage to Rameses and his achievements, was one of the grand temples during the Middle Kingdom. The temple was not only a place for great ceremonies, but it also served as a public building and as an important public and political center through which to project the image of Rameses II and his", "label": 1, "id": 100747}

Our results reproduce, at the mean-field level, the quantum corrections to the phase transitions in the single-particle phase space, in which the critical temperature is controlled by the single-particle BCS gap. In addition, the calculations of the phase diagram of the model are improved by the quantum correction formula, revealing more details in the phase diagram. A further study of the model in the mean-field regime is carried out, where the critical temperature $T_c$ vanishes in the one-loop correction, and thus provides a new example of quantum critical phenomenon in the single-particle picture.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.\\[MODEL\\], the $BCS$-model and the mean-field description of the $BCS$/BEC quantum phase transition are introduced.

{"text": "All the way though i was thinking to myself \"\"Oh shit... \"\" as some parts of the movie were completely and entirely horrible. The beginning was a good start and then the plot went completely and totally bad, because why not. There were several things i'd normally like to complain about, but i'll address each part individually and get my thoughts out there.\n\nFirst off, this movie is extremely racist and shows no concern regarding the very important concept of race.\n\nSo what we see in this movie is that a group of people (white people) who want to get over on people (black people) so they want to kill them all because those people are not worthy to be in their'sons club', (this is the only explanation that the movie presents) start a new race called \"the white race\" because this is the only race that is better than the other one. And they make black people their slaves so they don't have to kill each other and get upset over racial differences.\n\nAnd then after making more white people their slave this race begins to use each other for anything they want, and as soon as there are no more black people to 'get a cut of' this entire race (the white race) turns into a bunch of racist, horrible, and sick people because they are fed up with blacks and the whole thing.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, but everything i see (including some bad dubbing) made me just turn it off, it makes me look like a 'racist' (which i'm not, i'm just pointing out what i feel is wrong within the movie) and i don't have anything good to say, so i will just tell a story. Also this movie isn't my best, i'll admit but the last part sucked. I'm sorry i hate black people, (and to be honest i hate women as well (not in the movie though, they were all white, this is the first time i've really seen them) I am a homosexual, (but i never said i'm gay, lol)\n\nSo after the 'white race' murders a white woman (who is black) for reasons that make absolutely no sense they all turn into murderous racists and kill each other, and one of the two white people who survived this happens to get a 'cure'.\n\nNext thing the whole movie shows is the white people who turn to the black for protection, to save them from the racist group (this is the end of their lives, if you want to know the details about the movie please see my blog) and use them for whatever reason they want, which is what actually happens a lot.\n\nNow the two people who make the 'white' race stop eating babies, but not before he takes a baby 'white' person (this goes in a scene where they cut a baby's throat, the rest is blood) and then sets himself on the throne of their 'white race' by getting what he always wanted, (to be king)\n\nFirst they start using some of their 'white' people as slaves, first to be soldiers, but then are forced to become slaves of each other to get even with blacks. They set up prisons, and as soon as blacks leave in prison their children leave with them for no reason.\n\nAfter this they all become a bunch of racist murderers, but who is responsible for this group who are the most evil people in all of literature.\n\nThe last scene in the movie is a great one.\n\nThe end? Well, i guess like most movies it ends with a happy ending, so that's good, even if it isn't an ending that would make you sad and cry (it was a really sad scene in the movie, sad as any movie should be) But the fact that i won that movie is something i'm going to say 'thank you' for, so that means i'm glad that i didn't waste my time and money, and i was going to say goodbye to this movie. And i'll also say 'thank you' to this blog for telling me bad news about a great movie because i think that really hurts because i was excited to see the movie then i found out what i didn't like, and then i was ready to read this, only to see this post that talked about this horrible movie as if it was wonderful.\n\nI'll just say, i'd actually love if this movie ever got ported to an online platform (like Netflix, or HBO, or whatever) for me to watch it on for free, and i think it's a good idea for a movie that is so amazing and really needs to be seen.\n\nYou, me, and everyone we care about (and there are few) we love are all going to die at some point.\n\nI have no intention of dying before we do.\n\nThat is something i'll never lose, and the last thing i will ever have of any value is", "label": 1, "id": 100749}
{"text": "In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near present-day Loma, California called a terminus or hub, to serve transcontinental traffic. It was the first major railroad west of the Mississippi River, and it gave birth to an era of railroads and transcontinental travel that continues to the present day.\n\nA terminus or hub was in many ways the precursor to this modern era of rail travel, as it was the beginning of a rail line that connected with other branches from one point to the next, and provided rail access to points west that hadn\u2019t previously had connections with east by rail. The route to the Pacific, and later the Transcontinental Railroad, was made up of three different rail lines. The first, from Sacramento, California, to the Oregon coast, was a single track of 4,400 miles (or about 5,500 miles under current estimates), with each branch added after the Sacramento run. The second was the route from the Pacific coast to the Mexican border in present-day Northern California, and for many years from 1872 to 1885, was owned by the Central Pacific Railroad, and extended to the border. This link was the line to the east.\n\nIn 1886, the first transcontinental train of the new Transcontinental railroad, the Golden State Express, used the original section of the Pacific Railroad from Bakersfield to Vallejo, California. The Bakersfield-Valley Ford branch was completed soon thereafter between 1886, and 1887, connecting with a branch from Pueblo, New Mexico to St. Louis in the US Midwest. The final stage of the Pacific Railroad route to the west began in 1901, and finished in Chicago, Illinois. The last segment of line from Sacramento, California to St. Louis was completed in 1888, making it the world\u2019s longest single-track railroad built solely to support transcontinental rail service.\n\nThe route of the first transcontinental rail road was an important early rail link that contributed to the development of the western US. With a history spanning over a century, the Central Pacific Railroad and its predecessors are the oldest continuously operating railroad in North America.\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad\u2019s route through California is a fascinating, intricate and controversial story for which there is little historical record. While much of the Central Pacific\u2019s history has been lost and little was known about either its early years like the Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Railway, which started operation in the Santa Fe Canyon area of northern New Mexico in 1861 and ran to southern California in 1865, until the early 20th century.\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad, as we know them today, built the first route across the Sierra Nevada in 1870 to serve trade with the goldfields in southern Southeastern California. Two years later, Congress authorized the creation of the first transcontinental railroad. The transcontinental railroad was created on February 1, 1869, when President Andrew Johnson signed into law the Pacific Railroad Act of Congress created a transcontinental railroad route through territory from the southern border with Colombia to the Canadian border on either side of the 49th parallel and beyond. The Act of Congress was then codified into law by the United States\u2019 Congress and later signed by Andrew Johnson himself. The Central Pacific was created to build and operate such a railroad. The first locomotive of the Central Pacific was on April 24, 1872.\n\nThe railroad was owned by California\u2019s governor, Judah P. Benjamin. Benjamin was elected in 1859 for what was then the state Senate. At that time, the railroad was the main supplier to both the state and the nation of cotton. Cotton was a key export of California and the California economy had grown significantly in the 1850s, leading many to look to the railroad for transportation.\n\nThe Central Pacific line was completed in 1873. In 1875 and 1876, the Central Pacific completed two new bridges over the San Joaquin River and through the Sierra Nevada. Before the construction of the railroad, the route crossed the main trunk of the Sierra Nevada with many narrow cuts through the mountains to access the southern route. The tracks reached a peak elevation of over 14,000 feet. (The highest recorded rail gauge used at any point on a train is 3-inch, used by the Nevada spur). The route through California was one of the first true transcontinental routes to be built.\n\nThe Central Pacific built a route through and between California, from Sacramento to the Mexican border, and then through Bakersfield, bringing in over $5 billion in business for the Southern California region. Central Pacific locomotives carried passengers in California and carried mail for much of the rest of the US and Canada.\n\nThe route was completed by 1870, creating routes to the West Coast in California and from Sacramento to the Oregon Trail. The route would later be the basis of the transcontinental railroad with the completion of the final stretch to the border of California and the West Coast of the US in the 1890s, bringing", "label": 1, "id": 100750}

The third issue facing USL is that USL is not only a growing league that has a new ownership group, but its top team, the Wilmington Hammerheads, currently plays at the Carolina Challenge Cup, a soccer tournament held at WakeMed Soccer Park and broadcast by NBCUniversal Sports and Soccer United Marketing. That tournament attracts all the key soccer power ratings, too \u2014 in Charlotte and Raleigh at least.\n\nIn all, the USL\u2019s leaders are very concerned that MLS teams are taking over too many markets, and are taking their USL teams away from them. It goes against the whole model of a professional sports league to take on a soccer-specific stadium of USL status, a status that should belong to the top level of the sport and shouldn\u2019t be owned by the bottom level.\n\n[MORE Soccer | How USL gets deals]\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, all eyes went to a press conference featuring Mayor Michael B. Williams of Charlotte and MLS Commissioner Don Garber. On the line right along with the two, MLS Commissioner Don Garber repeatedly invoked both the Charlotte Hornets and the Charlotte Bobcats, referring to each as \u201crivalries.\u201d\n\nThe real question for MLS will be, when the league is finished with its three-phase plan in that three-market system, does Major League Soccer leave enough of the Charlotte market alone without worrying about a competitor trying to go into those same markets?\n\nGarber\u2019s answer was a blunt: \u201cNo. We will always compete with all the leagues.\u201d It was not an offer to stay out of Charlotte.\n\nBut it did point to another reality. Garber\u2019s answer only underlines MLS\u2019s need to make sure Charlotte is protected from competition. Garber is being a realist. He has said the number of expansion teams in MLS is capped at four, and that any expansion teams will come from existing markets. But he has hinted that even with those four \u2013 the Philadelphia Union, Orlando City, Miami Fusion and St. Louis FC \u2013 one MLS franchise could come from outside the league.\n\nGarber has a point. The most talked about of the four teams under consideration is Miami FC, a young team with a unique identity, and one which is more or less the equivalent of the Minnesota United/Real Salt Lake set-up. The NASL would be forced to come up with a new name, as there is no existing brand that the league has to use for the league as a whole. But Garber\u2019s point is, if MLS does not want Miami FC to take over and fill all of the seats in Miami\u2019s venues in the next decade, it would have to take a stronger stance on having MLS teams in Charlotte, Houston, San Antonio and Detroit. These four markets were the original six markets awarded to Major League Soccer \u2014 if MLS can\u2019t protect at least one of them, a deal on a similar basis to this one that gives MLS the Charlotte market would likely still be in play.\n\nIn the end, it isn\u2019t going to matter whether or not MLS is willing to be open about not being able to take over the Charlotte market. It is not going to matter, either, how much money MLS wants for a soccer-specific stadium project in Charlotte. The answer is irrelevant. It is not going to matter, either, whether or not the team is a potential MLS expansion team or a rival USL professional soccer team: Garber is saying, in the end, that if MLS can\u2019t protect Charlotte, MLS is going to put all of its eggs into the same basket of USL competition, and then whatever comes of that, it is going to come in the form of two MLS clubs or one.\n\n", "label": 1, "id": 100751}
{"text": "meynet & arnould ( 1993a ) have suggested that wolf pack structure in the southern U.S. and northern Eurasia is the result of random selection. From an evolutionary perspective, this theory has important implications for the origin and spread of the wolf. If all packs are structured randomly, then the possibility of a large genetic bottleneck in the ancestral species should be low. Such a genetic bottleneck would result even in the face of genetic drift for over 30 million years. This seems unlikely. However, several studies suggest that genetic Bottlenecks are occurring with rates of the order of 10-30 times larger than the ones observed from human societies. The results of these studies have implications for the wolf as an evolutionary model.\n\nA more radical hypothesis, one that is attractive in light of our understanding of genetic bottlenecks at the level of species, points to an alternative model (Hansen and Neel (1999)) in which wolf gene flow, at both the individual level and as a gene pool, has resulted in a pattern of genetic Bottlenecks. In this case, one cannot expect the wolf to evolve any more rapidly than other species, since genetic Bottlenecks might well have occurred on an unprecedented scale in wolf evolution (Arnould and Miethe (1999)).\n\n(b) The genetic Bottlenecks in the history of wolf evolution\n\nIt remains to be seen how the observed number of genetic Bottlenecks might change due to a more realistic model of the past. There are three reasons to have hope for this. This first is that in most cases, the number of genetic Bottlenecks that occurs is in fact fairly consistent with a genetic Bottleneck model (Hansen & Neel (1999); see also Christensen et al. (1993)). Second, if we accept the idea that most genetic Bottlenecks are indeed the result of a genetic bottleneck, then genetic bottlenecks are a simple, efficient and parsimonious mechanism for generating the observed patterns of genetic Bottlenecks. And third, this mechanism may well capture the dynamics which produced the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks.\n\nSeveral explanations for the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks have been offered. Two major types of explanation focus on the ecological and genetic mechanisms leading to or generating genetic Bottlenecks. The ecological explanation (Miethe (1997); see Arnould and Miethe (1999) for a review) relies on the observation that genetic bottlenecks usually occur in populations where there is a large drop in density. As pointed out by Miethe (1997, 1996, 1998), genetic bottlenecks can be caused by several mechanisms. For example, genetic drift can occur in very small populations and result in a lack of genetic variation. In such a case, the bottleneck can only be explained by natural selection (see e.g. Hoberg (1997)). Genetic bottlenecks caused by gene flow, on the other hand, should be more likely to occur in the larger species, and genetic bottlenecks should be more common in non-breeding than in breeding individuals (Fisher et al. (1996)).\n\nThe second type of explanation for genetic Bottlenecks focuses on gene flow, and specifically, on differences between sexes and between populations. The question is: why are there genetic Bottlenecks among individuals of the same (breeding) population but not between individuals from different (non-breeding) populations? The answer must, obviously, be in part to differences in allele frequencies in the different populations. Genetic Bottlenecks due to differences between populations have been observed in several species. The patterns observed in a number of studies have been suggestive of migration. However, it must be emphasized that such patterns have generally not been interpreted to support a significant contribution of migration. As K. Christensen and T.R. Pregill described, the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks in wolf, coyote and black vulture populations have been used to support an explanation for genetic Bottlenecks other than migration (Christensen & Pregill (1993b)). However, a recent study has shown that these patterns might well be consistent with the existence of gene flow and immigration from source populations (Arnould & Miethe (1998)). As suggested by these authors, genetic Bottlenecks due to gene flow might well have been present all along.\n\nThe second type of explanation for genetic Bottlenecks focuses on genetic drift, and specifically, on differences between populations. As outlined by several authors, a number of empirical studies have suggested that differences between populations are more likely to result in genetic Bottlenecks than similarities between populations. For example, in the wolf population investigated in this paper, there are genetic Bottlenecks between the eastern and southern U.S. populations. However, genetic Bottlenecks between the U.S. and Quebec populations appear to be uncommon. For the eastern population,", "label": 1, "id": 100752}

During his therapy sessions, LaForge and Doll undergo tests in which they are sent into the body and mind of their respective patients, who then enter the bodies of others. LaForge\u2019s tests are complicated and show how their patients\u2019 psychological and physical profiles evolve in ways that are difficult to predict. When they return to the base, their tests reveal that their patients will be the subject of further experiments, forcing the researchers to go back to Dr. Doll\u2019s laboratory for more funding.\n\nWith the help of the Fringe act, Dolls learns that her patient, the young woman, is not actually human, but possesses the abilities of a time-traveler; that the man being driven mad by his therapy sessions is in fact, her father who accidentally destroyed his brain and was sent back in time to the year 2000 to rescue his daughter, but did not succeed; and that he is slowly working to send LaForge back to the year 1000 in order to get the funding that they need that would cure their experimentally induced diseases. When LaForge sees the man who saved his life, he mistakes him for his father.\n\nLaForge, Doll, and their various medical experiments cause a sensation among medical personnel, the media, the public and each other among others, causing LaForge to find himself and his life under an unprecedented amount of scrutiny. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride for all of them that is constantly in their way.\n\nIn short, it was a complete waste of time. There were too many plots, ideas, and the whole story would come back with a vengeance if it were in prose.

However, as soon as I started reading it I quickly realized that I\u2019m not the kind of reader who will like to read many sci-fi books that are filled with crazy time dilation, alternate versions of history, and time travel, but I do like good dystopian novels, and I read them all the time, but I prefer to read fiction than nonfiction, so I tried my best to ignore my desire to read this book.\n\nAnd then we got to the conclusion. And I just wanted to cry. The conclusion was okay, honestly \u2013 I got some little plot points thrown out, but it was also okay. I do like to think \u201cthat one idea was not thrown out, that was just put in, and I\u2019m not sure how it ties in\u201d \u2013 but the actual story ended with no new characters being introduced, no new ideas being presented, and no information being given away.

{"text": "DirecTV Group (DTV) has a big call to make on Wednesday. On the heels of some very impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth that left them with $14 billion in net revenues for the third quarter of 2012, the company is calling on its subscribers to share in that progress and go even further.\n\nTheir message is that the biggest change this quarter is how they handle the content. The most obvious way is by adding channels. To accomplish that, they had to get the biggest merger of any cable company. That means they now have Disney plus ESPN plus HBO and Nickelodeon to build their business on.\n\nAfter three years of spending billions on network programming like ESPN, TNT, The Weather Channel and Disney ABC cable channels, the move to add the big three was an aggressive one and I was a little surprised that DirecTV kept doing it with such limited media offerings.\n\nDirecTV doesn't have quite enough content to fill the new channels, but it would have been impossible for them to try and squeeze it all out as long as the cable guy wanted to charge more for it.\n\nBut that's not what we're hearing from DirecTV. We're hearing from a source who worked on one of those Disney channels and has been talking to them for five weeks without any indication that they haven't yet had enough content.\n\nIf they had more content ready -- which we hear is the truth -- they would be building more, just like a grocery store needs product more than once a week.\n\nThis one is bigger than the $14 billion in net revenues that we heard from the company this morning but they say it's not nearly as big as it was in January 2012 when they had $19.9 billion in net revenues.\n\nBecause they had the big merger and now get the extra Disney channels, they now only have to sell the stuff to their customers. And that means they will sell more stuff, meaning we'll see more commercials in the future.\n\nOn a related note, the Wall Street Journal is doing some research on this and the top headline on the report is: \"Comcast\u2019s DirecTV Is Having a Harsh Reality Check.\"\n\nI'd link it but I won't, but if you dig deeper, you'll find that it takes some of the breath away from DirecTV's $5 billion in net bookings and some of its $4.2 billion in net profits in the quarter compared with the year before and that their margins are starting to creep back up, but not anywhere near the 50 or 60 percent that should make them a serious cable operator.\n\nHere's a question: why aren't they a serious cable operator?\n\nOn June 27, we posted this story to let you know the first of 13 predictions that analysts are working on for DirecTV.\n\nHere are some the top predictions for DirecTV that should become fact:\n\nPrediction #1: DirecTV's subscribers will have to pay for all online and mobile content.\n\nThe most shocking part of this one was right away: it came out of Comcast.\n\nIn the third quarter, they were spending $5.2 billion a year to pay Comcast to give them just about 200 hours of video. Comcast gets all that video at no charge to the subscribers.\n\nWhile it gives them content like their TV, it also gets them the traffic when you get onto their website and their streaming video service. That's another free service.\n\nThe only way for you to truly get rid of this traffic is to drop cable TV.\n\nOf course, you'd also have a little less content as well as TV, which Comcast doesn't mind giving.\n\nPrediction #2: DirecTV will become a one-call provider to get everything you need and nothing you don't.\n\nIn a world like this one, you have to be a one-call provider. You have to have a one-call option, so here is what they're doing: they're taking away any cable to cable and internet to data service.\n\nSo, if you want more content -- which would be nice -- you get less of it -- all paid for by this one call. That's the first part.\n\nPrediction #3: DirecTV won't make any other moves in its current business.\n\nThe second part is that with so much content, the cable guy's going to have to let go of so much. He's also probably going to get squeezed by so many options.\n\nPrediction #4: DirecTV is going to have to make changes on the content side of their business.\n\nThe two ideas here are that we'll see more of ESPN and the ability to pick up things like TNT. That's the second aspect.\n\nThe other part is that they would be better off having ESPN at a decent level going directly to them to give them $", "label": 1, "id": 100754}

Patients suffering from severe neurologic deficits or in whom epidural injection therapy yields unsatisfactory relief of the leg pain, might undergo lumbar laminectomy with laminoplasty. During the laminectomy, the facet joints are removed from the lamina and the remaining bony vertebral material is excised to create a solid fusion mass. While laminoplasty helps restore the patient to normal activity level and helps restore functionality, the risk of complications, such as infection and nonunion, is always present. These and other complications that might occur, if the technique were improperly performed, must be considered during the lumbosacral fusion as well.\n\n#### Laminoplasties {#cesec30}\n\nLaminoplasty is one of the most commonly used surgical techniques for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. In laminoplasty, facet joints are cut at the lamina and the remaining dural tissue is cut and retracted. Thereafter, autologous cancellous bone is inserted between the bony blocks. Autologous blood vessels to the bony spacer are also harvested. When the lamina is filled with bone or marrow, a solid bony fusion is achieved. When the bone that was obtained from the patient's iliac crest has been processed into bone marrow, this autologous bone marrow can be used for the replacement of all or part of the spinal column, which leads to complete regression of the symptomatic spinal stenosis and recovery of normal back function.\n\nCONCLUSIONS {#cesec31}\n===========\n\nThere are numerous techniques for lumbar spinal decompression and stabilization, and each modality has its own inherent advantages and drawbacks.

{"text": "it has been widely shown that the cosmological parameters and primordial power spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_{s}$ can be constrained by combining the CMB observations. This is mainly due to the fact that the CMB observations are not necessarily tied to the properties of the dark energy. However, in some regions (namely, very small scales $k_{\\star}\\ll aH(t_0)$[^3]), the properties of the dark energy and the initial perturbations are nearly the same, which is in contradiction to the existing theoretical understanding. In order to have a more definite picture, in this subsection we will take into account the effect of the dark energy perturbations on the CMB. We will further show that we can constrain the equation of state by combining the CMB data and the Hubble parameter information.\n\nWe first assume the scale factor is given by $a(t) = \\left[1-\\epsilon(t)\\right]t$, where $\\epsilon(t)$ comes from the dark energy in the universe, i.e., $\\epsilon(t)=\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)=-\\ddot{\\epsilon}(t)$, where a dot means Euler integration, since we consider a universe with zero-index Dark Energy. It has been pointed out in the literature [@Zhao:2016dzp; @Zhao:2016hpx; @Geng:2016tnn] that the model proposed in Eq. could only fit the data of low $\\ell$ or high-$\\ell$ temperature combinations. However, our results suggest that the equation of state $w$ can be fitted by combining the temperature and polarization anisotropy data. The reason is that, in the slow-roll approximation, $n_{s}$ is a conserved quantity (see Eq.) and $\\epsilon$ is very small at $t<t_{0}$. Therefore, the equation of state $w$ should not be too different from that of the non-relativistic case with $\\epsilon\\ll 1$. Moreover, this case can help us understand the difference between dark energy and dark matter.\n\nNow we further estimate the effect of initial conditions on the CMB observation. We first consider the evolution of perturbations in the $n=0$ case. For the sake of illustration, we will take the parameter as very small $\\epsilon=0.1\\Delta$ (i.e., $0=1-\\epsilon$). Our results show that the effect of initial conditions does not change the order of magnitude at the subhorizon scale in this case. In order to show this, we plot the ratio of the ratio of the perturbations and the ratio of the $w$ value between the case with $n_{s}<1$ (dark energy with $w<-1$) and the case with $n_{s}>1$ (dark energy with $w>-1$). The ratio reads as $R_{1}(n_s)=\\left[\\frac{R(1+\\epsilon)-R^{-}}{R^{-}-R^{-1}}\\right ]\\delta_{s}^{2}+6n_{s}\\Delta/\\epsilon^{2}$, which only contributes in the interval $n<2$. We take $R_1=R^{-}_{1}(n_s)+6n_{s}\\Delta/\\epsilon^{2}|_{n<2}$, where $R^{-}_{1}(n_s)=1$ in the case of $n_s>1$. The curves are obtained by numerically solving the linear perturbation equation.

An immunoblot probed with antibodies against outer membrane proteins ( lysines) revealed bands corresponding to the lysine-sensitive protein band in the cytosolic fraction of Mtb wild type during growth in n-acetyl-L-cysteine (1). In contrast, there were no such bands in the wild type strain grown without n-acetyl-L-cysteine (11,4). These results indicate that the mycolic acid in the outer membrane and in the OMV is covalently linked to cell wall proteins and OMV glycoproteins. Therefore, we used the antisera to these cell wall proteins to immunolocalize the cell wall proteins in permeabilized OMV preparations by transmission electron microscopy. OMV lysates were labeled with anti-lysine antibodies and electron-dense particles were observed in the OMVs ( 12 ). Figure 1. OMV immunolocalization of lysines. Lysine-sensitive, mycobacterial species were grown in either the absence or presence of n acetyl-L-cysteine. The cells were cultured on a bacteriological agar plate. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and OMVs purified. Lysine labeling and immunoelectron microscopy was performed. Representative areas (1/4 mm2 and 1 mm deep) are shown with the corresponding enlargement (10 \u03bcm). The cells on both sides of the section were labeled with antibody against Lysine protein. The scale bar = 1 \u03bcm. Figure 2. Immunogold EM of lysine labeling after permeabilization. (A) OMV immunolocalization of lysine-sensitive proteins. OMVs were labeled with anti-lysine antibodies followed by gold-gold conjugation.

{"text": "The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time Capsule Day. I like to get the children involved in this activity. Here is a picture we took, using an antique \u201933 Ford Sedan from my parents garage. My grandmother has many of our old autos in her garage. This is probably our fourth attempt to start it, because the first couple of times the kids all over the place and they couldn\u2019t get the car going. The first time we used a tractor to start it and this is why we have a lot of rust! So we resorted to the car and waited.\n\nAs you can see, we ended up getting the car started!\n\nThe next few items on the agenda involve books, music and art projects. In this next post, I\u2019ll share how we started a collection of books that we\u2019ll take on road trips. This is an idea for a road trip to the Bahamas to visit our grand nephews. We will be using this idea to make a mini library to take on our next trip to Texas.\n\nWe visited the art room a few weeks ago to select paint colors and get some ideas for a garage sale art project. I\u2019d love to know what ideas you suggest for a car, garage and art room decorating project that you would plan for our next visit.\n\nWhen it comes to the books, how do you choose what to read? I\u2019ve always had a problem with choosing what to read. The problem is I usually don\u2019t know what to start with, so it\u2019ll always be on the back burner. There are many books that I read, yet don\u2019t find that the reading of any other book interests me. This is a problem that we\u2019re having on many levels and I have yet to be able to resolve it. I want everything I read to be relevant to my life, yet it is very challenging to read several hundred pages of a book without having any interest whatsoever.\n\nI\u2019m still working on this problem and have found that I really need to have a \u2018go to book\u2019 before starting on a new book. I\u2019ll share a few books in the next few posts, including some book suggestions from our kids. I hope you find these ideas helpful as you consider this problem that I have.\n\nIn any project, the first requirement is planning. My first thought was to start by creating our book idea, so we\u2019d have a lot of materials at our disposal, but that idea didn\u2019t work. Then I\u2019ve thought of starting our project with our garage, but that still didn\u2019t seem to cut it. So we kept brainstorming a new idea.\n\nEnter the challenge: planning each project according to your idea, then working that plan into your real life activities.\n\nWe did just that.\n\nHere is the list of projects that our garage and kitchen will be used for. Now we have to determine which projects will be included. Next it will be up to our kids to choose what activities they like and to incorporate them in our project.\n\nThe kids chose art activities and began making scrap pieces for paint. They cut out paper, then glued them into tiny \u2018bins\u2019 about 1/4\u2033 high.\n\nThey used a spray bottle to get the white on the bottom of the paper to blend in with the color, making them look like they were painting with a marker.\n\nWe used a can of spray paint to paint the back of the bins and also the inside, to cover the glue.\n\nWhile we were using spray paint to mark the bin, we also went to the store and picked up some water-soluble paint. This is really helpful if you are working with little kids. You mix a little amount of the water-soluble in a spray bottle, then you rub or squirt that mixture onto the surface that will be painted with water. It dissolves the surface coating and leaves an even washable coating.\n\nThis was the first painting of the project and the only part that I was able to complete in the car.\n\nHere it is hung in a garage, now with the paint. The picture was also in the books as part of the art project. This painting makes it look like it\u2019s on display. We also took the picture of our grandchildren playing in the snow and hung that outside too.\n\nI did have this one project complete at home, but it was out of the house with the kids, then we moved on to the next project.\n\nThis painting is hanging in our garage. We\u2019ll also use this idea for a book storage cabinet.\n\nWe did all of the book painting and shelving in the garage, but I found some pictures for photos. Our garage was the perfect setting.\n\nThe car was the perfect", "label": 1, "id": 100761}

I try and be creative because if I go a little bit more clinical I can do that. But I've always been a good finisher with the ball.\n\n'Whether it was the run out or on the break I was confident to put the ball in the back of the net and I've always been a threat from open play.'\n\nReading started as one of the better sides in League One, but their first half fell apart and Cairney was at the centre of it.\n\n'We tried to play a simple game in the first half but it wasn't up there with anyone else,' said Reading manager Ian Holloway.\n\n'They kept pressing us around the box at all angles and put plenty of bodies where their goal wasn't. It's an awful position and I think the referee took a look at that in the first half.\n\n'Every time we'd get a sniff they'd press up higher and higher and once they got a bit more pressure I thought we'd be in trouble.'\n\nAnd they kept on getting that close as Reading went on another run of nine goals in ten games stretching their unbeaten run to four matches.\n\nReading's James McClean and his left wing partner, Alex Pearce, also scored in their final league game, but Cairney wasn't the only one to score with an amazing strike against Forest.\n\nThis is a different Cairney to the one the Reading boss watched last season. He is more confident, much happier and has taken the captaincy off a player who won't be around for much longer.\n\n'I'm probably going to be more aggressive in the last ten games,' the man himself said.\n\n'You have to be clinical and if I'm not in the flow of things like I would like to be then I have to make myself a nuisance. That's where I get my chances and my success. I always like to contribute.'\n\nIt's the kind of season he may never again get.\n\n'It's hard to think of a player who has enjoyed a run like that and when I look at the players in front of me then it's not really good or bad at all.\n\n'This one is good for myself when it all comes to an end because I don't want to finish my career on a bad note. I'm trying to finish the season well and hopefully we'll be safe in the final game of the season.'\n\nIt can't be easy for a player who has got a contract to walk away and there's a real sense of pride at the end of last season when he picked up his final winner, his first of three penalty strikes since October 2009.\n\nBut there's pressure on all players to make a quick decision and be true to their career goals. Cairney has admitted this latest run could end in failure.\n\nHe said: 'It's not just the last few games of the season but the whole season. There's a lot of games and a lot of competitions so it could be a little bit hard but I'm not the type of player who can take things for granted, even when the season is so long at the end. It's a new start - the club's new owner and new management. There's a lot of pressure.\n\n'But I've been here for six years and when it's all over I'd like to do something memorable for them and for myself. So hopefully it will be that. I'm happy to stay for another season because it's been a good time.\n\n'I think the manager has picked the best line up ever and it will be another good season.'\n\nHis wife, Mandy, was at the training ground when he picked up the telephone to tell her. 'The whole staff were watching and they all said their good words of encouragement,' he said. 'They've gone a long way but you've got to do it. It was the perfect end.\n\n'It's not the end of my career but it's the end of something really beautiful, where I can be with lots of people, be at a club with a lot of fun. I wouldn't be able to do that for anywhere else but Reading.\n\n'The team has grown in size and strength every year and the support for the team has just kept getting bigger so I've started to take a little bit of confidence from that.\n\n'You just take something from every occasion you've been at and it's just another game to get better in. It could be a good end for me but it's not my final game", "label": 1, "id": 100762}

{"text": "the obstruction of the superior vena cava ( svc ) ). For this reason some of the vessels used in their assessment are technically unsuitable for this purpose. However, some studies are available which show the reliability of non-invasive methods in assessing the svc and have used them to evaluate the patency of the svc. The aorta ( svc ), is relatively easily assessed by several methods. However, an accurate evaluation of the svc is difficult as it is often surrounded by pulsating and torsioned vessels. Several methods have been evaluated in the assessment of this vessel. Some of methods are based on pulsating waves as they allow to perform aorto-aortic retrograde pressure measurement while others use Doppler aorto-venous flow measurements. These last methods have a high interest for the clinician to use them as an alternative procedure to conventional invasive angiography. Some studies are also available to assess coronary vessels such as the origin of the left coronary artery (s.c. left main stem). However, some of these methods are very difficult to perform with current techniques. The most reliable way to evaluate the svc for an accurate and reliable evaluation of patency is by means of angiography when a contrast medium is injected into the svc before angiographic examination. Furthermore, the study of svc occlusion by means of angiography has been very much developed in recent years and has been proved to be highly accurate.\n\nThis article aims to review the different non-invasive approaches for the evaluation of the svc, summarizing their respective strengths and limitations, in order to help clinicians to make better decisions in the evaluation of these patients. The main question that clinicians must address when considering diagnostic procedures for evaluating congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary vascular malformations are: which non-invasive procedure is the best one to use? A thorough examination of the available methods, their limitations, and their usefulness in the evaluation of the aorta and the svc is necessary to answer this question.\n\nThe current paper focuses on non-invasive assessment of the inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) with special emphasis on its pathophysiology, the clinical context and different non-invasive diagnostic methods used to assess its patency. A thorough analysis of the various methods used to assess the occlusion of the svc and the evaluation of its patency have been performed using a systematic review methodology.\n\nDifferent studies have been reported in the literature on the patency of the inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) in different heart defects under the assumption that the patency of inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) affects the cardiac performance. Non-invasive radiological methods have become the mainstay of evaluation of the extent and severity of aortic diseases, being frequently used in aortic surgery. On the contrary, less attention has been given to the evaluation of the svc and its patency.\n\nIn the current study, we review different non-invasive techniques employed to assess the svc and its patency. We have applied a systematic review approach to all available literature in order to summarize different methods used to assess the patency of the svc, both in children and adults and to evaluate their applicability in evaluation of patients with congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary malformations. Based on this systematic review, a meta-analysis was performed of the literature available regarding assessment of the svc using non-invasive diagnostic procedures in patients with cardiovascular defects.\n\nThe most reliable way to assess patency of aortic or superior vena cava, though, remains aortography, since the vascular supply to those vessels arises from two or three pulmonary arteries. The aortography is a widely used method in many patients with congenital heart defects for evaluation of aortic disease and its abnormalities. Although its use and applicability are based on clinical experience and well-designed studies with prospective design, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of aortography in cases of congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary malformations.\n\nThe aortocoronoar vein connection (avc) is the normal anastomosis of the innominate artery ( sa ) with the inferior vena cava ( svc ) and the left common cardinal artery ( sa ) with the subclavian artery ( svc ). In the majority of patients, the avc is usually not an obstacle to the flow of blood between left and right vascular systems, and is often not an impediment to the outflow of blood from the right side of heart. The avc does not appear to cause any problem during exercise, hemodynamic changes or in patients with normal cardiac rhythm. However, some of the", "label": 1, "id": 100764}

{"text": "In 2014, economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency said that one in ten American children were overweight, nearly one in five had diabetes, and one in eight were on medication for high blood pressure.\n\nChildren, particularly boys, are often the most active consumers of sports in our society. That is important, because they play at more competitive levels than other adolescents. But we also need their ability to play sports without fear of injury, because, in many instances, their behavior and personality can help us understand a lot about their future, and how they can change their behavior to be better for themselves and for others, as well as for their communities. There seems to be a greater emphasis on competitive sports among young boys than young girls, which is true in many sports (and in academic and performance excellence too). Even in non-competitive sports such as running, swimming, biking and martial arts, participation is often more strongly associated with boys. The reason is not clear, although certainly there is competition in every life context.\n\nWhile I have been fortunate to be around sports throughout my career for much of my life, and have seen more males enter my discipline of sport psychology, my experience has mostly been during their adolescent years. During these years, most of the issues I hear most about are related to the adolescent phase of boys who decide to be involved in sports, rather than in their later years on, or as adults with sports.\n\nIn a report by the New Zealand Ministry of Health, conducted among youth in the country in 2006, more than half of all boys were obese, and more than 40 percent of boys had an overabundance of body fat, and were more than two years younger than their peers. Those who were obese were more likely to have more negative attitudes towards life and other people, with more suicidal thoughts and more social dissatisfaction, were often unhappy with school grades, and were more likely to have ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. Not surprisingly, those who were less physically active and had a lower fitness level were also more likely to be obese.\n\nIt took only twenty-five short minutes for a group of twenty boys to walk a total of approximately 3.5 miles, covering a distance of over one hundred yards. This short and pleasant walk was done in twenty-four to twenty-eight degree heat, with the boys all wearing street clothes. It could have been the walk from school to the field to practice, or from the athletic field to the school track, or from their own home to a sporting event. Whatever the reason, the journey involved walking on different streets as they walked on the city's busiest downtown, along busy country roads, and at the bottom of the steep hills in the country in a park.\n\nIn some cultures and societies, there is also a more relaxed attitude toward and encouragement of boys, in addition to a positive relationship with sport. It will be recalled that when I joined my undergraduate alma mater fifteen years ago, it was a rather mixed environment, and I could see the difference with more gender equality and openness. But now, twenty years later, with the attitudes we live with, the school is divided into gender-segregated classrooms. It is a place where many of the most aggressive athletes are on the track, and I have seen many more aggressive behaviors and attitudes there, many more challenges to other students' mental and physical health, and at much higher levels than before.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that gender equality has an important impact on the relationship and attitude of male and female young people to sport, I see a significant role for family and neighborhood play in how boys relate to sport. It certainly is true that in most families, sport and physical activity begin early on, and then many boys and girls enter the sports in which they become competitive and enjoy; but there is also a difference, in that in almost every young family, sport and physical activity go in different directions.\n\nIn fact, I have worked with and with teenage boys to establish a very positive relationship with sports in the context of their family and their neighborhood school, as I have done and as other researchers have done. There are a variety of different ways of approaching this approach. There is some research and experience that we have learned from studying adolescent girls, for example, who enter an sport competitively in the first phase of adolescence, with competitive and personal goals. Some other girls also start in this competitive phase of adolescence, but then choose to pursue other areas of interest, and even to pursue an interest in the more recreational realm, including sports, rather than being drawn in this competitive direction all the way to the end of adolescence. In these cases, it can be helpful to find a different group to work with when one is exploring a more competitive role.\n\nMost boys do not enter the competitive sport arena until they are in middle or high school years. While this seems to be true in many cases, as well as in the most aggressive, the boys who enter the sport arena in my", "label": 1, "id": 100767}
{"text": "From the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered greatly from the plague: they found it more and more of a challenge to hunt, to harvest crops, even to catch their own lambs. As a result, many farmers moved to the plains between the river and the Rhine.\n\nThe most important town between Aachen and Basel, in the former kingdom of the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, was Sigmaringen, which became a major producer of arms, which was often exported to Austria, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. When the W\u00fcrttembergs ruled Sigmaringen and Baden as a separate entity from other parts of Thuringia for more than 350 years, the city is known by many names and in very different ways: Rheinsberg (Red Hill), Krumau (Roman city), Aachen, Durlach, Sigmaringen, Freiburg, or Baden.\nSigmaringen was a very important cultural meeting place at the time, with writers, artisans, architects and musicians regularly visiting with their families and colleagues. With the rise of Romanticism and the beginnings of German nationalism, Sigmaringen was for many years a home for radicals and revolutionists. The town quickly developed as one of the most important of the northern regions, and also as one of the leading centres of the German Protestant movement, which by that time dominated all of German Protestantism.\n\nThe town also saw two major wars between different Protestant groups: the war between the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Church, and two wars between the Catholics and the Protestant Germans (German Revolution). The Reformation had been brought to France but was not a success, and the German Protestants had to find a new homeland in Sigmaringen, as well as in other German towns like Plettenberg or L\u00fcbeck.\n\nThe city was also known for trade and its growing export market, including such things as beer. However, Sigmaringen quickly developed into a cultural centre which soon attracted artists as well as artists' families to settle in the town. Not least important, Sigmaringen had a substantial art museum with a fine collection of Renaissance and Baroque painting, with many of the works having been painted in Paris and Italy.\n\nAnother highlight of Sigmaringen's cultural life came with the performance of Bach's German oratorio. Sigmaringen, as the capital of Sigmaringen county, was part of the famous Bach Festival in Leipzig from 1866 until the Second World War. The musical world of Sigmaringen was also important for other composers from the same period as Bach, like Richard Wagner to the north, and Paul Hindemith to the south (see musical movement), but not least for Franz Schubert, whose Schubert song cycle was composed in Sigmaringen.\n\nDuring the War of the Fourth Coalition and again during the Second World War, for the most part Sigmaringen was not damaged; unlike many German towns, it did not suffer much from bombardment and bombing from the air. Sigmaringen's centre of social and cultural life did not suffer too much, as German intellectuals and artists were able to stay after the war, like Hans Geiringer did in the 1920s.\n\nFamous individuals of that time could include several statesmen: the German statesman and president Konrad Adenauer (1921\u201373), the poet Richard Duttenhofer (1924\u201365), and the philosopher Georg Gadamer (1870\u201362) \u2013 Georges H\u00e8ze and Max Horkheimer are also said to have visited Sigmaringen from 1930 to 1932 while being in exile in America with Adorno.

This shape has a flat rear, a rounded front and an elliptic side view (Fig. 1.3).\n\n FIGURE 1.3 Flat-back vehicle silhouette.\n\nThe term \"flat back\" emphasizes the shape of the vehicle silhouette above the steering wheel (Fig. 1.4). It is usually produced by a special flat-back design (a.k.a. the \"V-pillar\" rear view mirror) to reduce interference with headlamps, see Fig. 1.4(f\u2032). This type of flat-back silhouette is considered the \"perfect\" vehicle silhouette and its shape is well defined and well characterized, as shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\n FIGURE 1.4 Flat-back vehicle silhouettes.\n\n##  1.2.  The Dynamic Profile\n\nThe vehicle silhouette is the shape determined by and depends on the driver's movements. This shape is determined by a combination of the driver's vision, road, traffic and ambient conditions. The first two conditions affect the headlamp silhouette shape, while the latter two determine the vehicle silhouette shape.\n\nGiven the vehicle speed and the driver's and passengers' height, the vehicle rear profile will change as the headlamp profile changes, and vice versa. Both the driver's and passengers' body proportions are affected by headlamp position.\n\nThe driver's proportions are determined mostly by vision, as shown in Fig. 1.5: with front-on or rear-on headlamp position, the upper arm (upper arm height) and nose extension (nose height) will be greater compared to the frontal area; if the headlamp is inclined towards the rider (the \"headlamp position is rear-on\") and the speed increases, headlamp position will change and rider proportions will change. The body proportions at normal headlamp position (front-on) are the same for front-on and rear-on headlamp position, although the rearward position is used for rear-on headlamp position.\n\n FIGURE 1.5 Vehicle rear profiles.\n\nThe driver's vision also determines the vehicle rear width, as shown in Fig. 1.6. With increasing passenger height, the driver's view will extend behind the front end of the vehicle and the vehicle width will increase, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\n\n FIGURE 1.6 Driver's view for flat and inclined vehicle rear profile.\n\nThe driver's vision also determines the vehicle width for different front-inclination angles, as shown in Fig. 1.8: with increasing passenger height, the front end of vehicle extends behind the headlamp to become wider and the vehicle width increases, as shown in Fig. 1.9.\n\n##  1.3.  Front End of Vehicle (Rear profile)\n\nThe front end of the vehicle profile has its center of gravity at the front fender tip in the front fender opening region of the vehicle wheel. The headlamp protrudes slightly beyond the front fender opening in the front fender opening region of the vehicle wheel, as seen in Fig. 1.10(a). Headlamp height also determines the front fender opening in front-on headlamp position and this height is about one-third smaller than the headlamp base width. The front fender opening is in the front fender region (the region between the front fender and the vehicle wheel side flange) and is typically three inches wide. The front fender opening is not symmetrical to the vehicle wheel center line. The front fender is not round due to the vehicle wheel centerline having small radius of curvature.\n\n FIGURE 1.6 Driver's view (normal position) for various front-inclination angles.\n\nFront-inclination angle to the horizontal determines the side profile of the vehicle silhouette. With increasing front-inclination angle, the vehicle silhouette becomes wider at the headlamp center due to headlamp protrusion out of the front fender, as shown in Fig. 1.14(a) and Fig. 1.12(a). Because the headlamp protrusion is about one-third smaller than the headlamp tip width, the headlamp tip width increases compared to the vehicle width and the vehicle side profile becomes wider at the headlamp center, as shown in Fig. 1.15. The side profile of the vehicle silhouette remains symmetrical with respect to the front-inclination angles, but the side radius of curvature is reduced and the vehicle silhouette becomes relatively wider at the headlamp center.\n\n FIGURE 1.7 Driver's view for various vehicle widths.\n\nThe vehicle front profile has a low center of gravity.

{"text": "the loss of a coding nucleobase from   the    Phe codon is    determined.        \n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 627 (1991).\n\n2.5.8 Amino Acid Uptake Mechanisms\n\nAmino acids are involved in cell and organ growth and in metabolic pathways. Consequently, they can be taken up by mechanisms which have evolved over many millions of years of evolution (see Chapters 3 and 11 in this volume, and Chapters 9,, and ). Some proteins such as the transferases take up a wide range of amino acids from many different metabolic pathways [see references (16) and (17) in Chapter 3. For example, the human transferase system can take up the amino acids lysine, serine, tyrosine, methionine, threonine and valine from amino acid metabolism. The human transferase system does so by means of a large number of different transferases specific for that particular amino acid: that is, the human system can take up as many as 19 different amino acids from several metabolic pathways.\n\nThe mechanism of uptake at the level of the metabolic pathway is quite complex. At the metabolic pathway level, there are numerous different carrier/substrate binding proteins which bind to the various substrates (e.g. amino acids) for a limited period of time (e.g. hours) during which the substrate is transported to the tissue from which the substrate is taken up.\n\nIn mammalian organs, these carrier/substrate binding proteins have evolved into specific cell surface receptors which are specific for particular organ and cell types as described previously[]. Substrates are taken up into the cell through the active process of receptor binding; the substrates are then passed to other binding proteins, which release the substrates (for example, amino acids) which are then taken up by the other carrier/substrate binding proteins, and so on. The mechanism of transmembrane transporter operation in many cells is illustrated in Fig. 3.6 in this volume.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 627 (1991).\n\n2.5.9 Protein Structure and Function\n\nEach amino acid has a chemical formula (the chemical structure) comprising one chiral form with one of the two forms shown in Table A-1 in the appendix of Chapter 3. The chemical formula for L-leucine is C14H23N3O2 and the chemical formula for D-leucine is C14H23N3O2. A chemical form of most amino acids has some structural characteristics and the amino acid structure contains certain functional properties such as protein folding and three dimensional structure properties in particular. The chemical structure of leucine and other amino acids involves the presence of a pair of stereocentres. The chiral form of leucine is called the L-form and the other chiral form, the D-form; and the two enantiomers (enantiomers are considered to be mirror images) have opposite chiral forms (e.g. D-leucine cannot be considered an enantiomeric mirror image but is considered as the same diastereomer as L-leucine but with an opposite chirality). The mirror image relationship for amino acids has been shown to be the molecular basis of molecular symmetry and spatial organization.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 618 (1991).\n\n2.5.10 Amino Acid Metabolism\n\nThe protein sequences within the various proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism have been studied using computer and biochemical methods (see below). A sequence of the amino-acid-containing sequences from several metabolic pathways for a number of different genes is shown in the appendix of Chapter 3 and a phylogenetic tree (also called a phylogenetic dendrogram) is described below as being an example of genetic relationships in DNA (a dendogram).\n\nFIGURE 2.2: Mechanism of protein degradation and protein recycling\n\nTwo primary degradation pathways are known for protein breakdown. First, during normal metabolism, amino acids are used for protein production and as metabolic building blocks for non-protein cellular components [see the sections below 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 in Chapter 2; and references (13), (14) and (15) in Chapter 2]. Second (Fig. 2.2), the protein chains that are formed during each amino acid metabolism are broken down and then used for new production. Second, there is a third mechanism which is responsible for amino acid degradation, in which an amino acid is converted first to its corresponding keto-acid and then further oxidation to the corresponding carboxy-acid. The oxidation of the amino acid to the corresponding carboxy-acid is a part of a mechanism to recycle the amino acids.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry", "label": 1, "id": 100771}

{"text": "I saw this movie when I was about 12 when I was sick with a cold and sitting at home. I had an idea about the movie that I thought was interesting so I decided to watch it that night to see if I liked it. Once I saw it I liked it even more and now I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it ever since. The main thing I like about the movie is that even though the main character is a girl, the movie deals with the topic of prejudice a lot which gets us deep into the issue of racism and how it affects people. We finally get a little glimpse on how racism is and why it exists.\n\nThe movie follows a girl named Anzalel, her brother (Benny) and her cousin (Misha) who are always worried about her. Anzalel is a white-skinned child who lives with her Indian parents. She\u2019s always teased about looking just like the white girl. She\u2019s always worried about her weight and being picked on her by the boys. She tries to be nice and act as a good friend for the white girls while her cousins try to tease her and try to get more attention than her. On top of that, she has a crush on a boy who plays football with boys. She also tries to hang out with her neighbor (Ann Marie) but he\u2019s so focused on his football and music that he doesn\u2019t know how to be a friend to anyone. The biggest question people are asking about is, is she even related to the boy she has a crush on? We\u2019ll find out later.\n\nFirst off, the plot is really original and I love that it\u2019s not boring. There are a lot of different plot lines that play a major role in the movie. There is the plot line where they are going to have to pretend to be boyfriend/girlfriend to a girl who likes them. Then there is the plot line with the neighbor. Then there\u2019s even a lot of weird stuff that the siblings just end up falling through and getting lost in. They make it complicated but it\u2019s all made to be endearing at the same time. The film has a lot of humor and it\u2019s very endearing.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting films to come out in quite some time. The actors are super cute. Both of the parents are excellent and I love that the parents try to make their child look better than the child they created. I thought Misha\u2019s parents looked really young, like kids that are in elementary school, so it was nice and relatable to me. I was kind of disappointed by the black female character because I didn\u2019t think she was black enough. There\u2019s no racial tension in the movie because it does not really deal with racism but more about the prejudices and how they are passed onto girls. The film deals with a lot of different topics and the characters deal with everything. There are also a lot who get lost in it, but they all make up for it.\n\nThere was a really funny scene that came with the main protagonist that I definitely had to talk about. It\u2019s basically like a very long monologue where she talks about how much she loves this character on her cousin\u2019s side. It\u2019s also about how she looks at this other person and she thinks they are her boyfriend/girlfriend. I think it\u2019s really funny because on some level you can interpret the relationship and her crush on this character. On another level, I don\u2019t think her character is even in the movie because it doesn\u2019t really feel like there\u2019s her character that I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s for a while.\n\nIt has a very different story than similar films, it\u2019s very original. There are a lot of different themes and a lot of characters, and it ends up being really interesting and funny. Even though this is not the most original movie, I think I still liked it, even though it\u2019s not really in my usual genre. I just love the art of movies and it\u2019s really nice to see a movie this unique. I don\u2019t usually buy movies that I don\u2019t know in my genre but this one really grabbed my attention. I would recommend this movie to anyone.\n\nI am on a search, I believe it\u2019s called. It\u2019s called finding a friend, finding a best friend and then finding what it looks like like for our friendship to continue past that point. I have never been in a friendship group in my life. I have only had really great friends and have made close friendships with people, but I never really felt in a group. I was always lonely in groups so I never really knew it until the film, the film, in my opinion, just about found a friend. I didn\u2019t", "label": 1, "id": 100773}
{"text": "It was shown by Ladner that if P \u2260 NP then the \"difficulty\" of the NP problem is strictly inferior to the difficulty of a given NP problem. And if P = NP then such problems are \"equivalent\" in that it is impossible to find two problems that are \"equivalent\" in terms of their NP-difficulty. In effect, problems in NP are too hard for anyone to solve.\n\nIn this case we could prove the existence of NP problems that are \"hard\" in the sense that there is no algorithm that can solve them in exponential time, or that can solve them in polynomial time with a bound that will be tight when the algorithm starts with an input which is a valid instance of an NP problem (in the case where P \u2260 NP the \"bound\" has to be defined in terms of a lower bound, as in the \"time-out\" result of the Toda argument).\n\nThe fact that any problem can be expressed as a subset of a fixed boolean circuit is known as the Dickson's Lemma, which is the basis for the proof that any non-trivial problem can be defined as a subset of a fixed Boolean circuit.\n\nIt was further studied by Zuse, who proved that every non-trivial decision problem can be reduced in polynomial size to some problems in the complement language of a certain fixed language, the so-called language of the complement of the problem. He called such languages \"complete\" languages, because the languages of any such problem form a complete lattice, and any non-trivial decision problem is the intersection of complete languages. He also proved that the complexity of any problem can be expressed as the language intersection of certain complete languages. This problem was later generalized by Garey and Johnson to express the complexity of any problem as the intersection of arbitrary finite sets of complete languages, and was further generalized by Cook to express the complexity of any problem as an intersection of complements of arbitrary functions (a.k.a. the NP-completeness of the problem).\n\nIn any Boolean circuit-based complexity class, the complexity of a problem is the size of the smallest Boolean function of that problem that would be able to do the computation. In order to decide whether or not a decision problem is in P, D, or NP, that is, whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable, deterministic-time solvable and quantum-time solvable respectively, we would like this function to be \"small\" in the first two cases, and \"large\" in the third case.\n\nIn this case, if P = NP or NPT, one may be able to convert the decision problem into a much easier problem, and use efficient algorithms for the easier problem to solve the original problem. However, that is not what \"NP hardness\" meant in NP-completeness theorems. These theorems are named after the (complement of the) language of \"NP hard\" (that is, complements of NPE and NP).\n\nIn particular, the languages of problems P = NP and NPT are not complete.\n\nNP-complete problems are very close to being trivial. For example, if P\u2260NP or NPT, then any given problem that is in neither P nor NP is contained within the complement of the language of problems P = NP and NPT. This is shown by showing that the P = NP problem for P \u2260 NP is also contained within the complement of NP-complete languages. This gives an efficient way to solve NP-complete problems, even if the original problem was hard. The proof uses the famous Toda theorem. This theorem can be considered a generalization of G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, and is a special case of Valiant's theorem in logic. In this case, Valiant proved that if P = NP then the NP-hard problem cannot be written as P + NPHW. In other words, it cannot be recursively encoded within the logic L of the language of (complement of the) language of NP-hard problems. Since NP and NPHW are not \"equivalent\" languages, this implies that NP-hard problems in NP-complete languages cannot be \"encoded\" with the logic P \u2260 NP and NPHW. This is the reason why \"NP hardness\" cannot be reduced from \"P to NP\" and \"NPT hardness\" cannot be reduced from \"NPHW to NP,\" like we saw above. Similarly, in the case of NPT-hard problems we cannot reduce \"NP to NP\" and \"NC to NP\" and \"P to NP,\" because of Valiant's theorem.\n\nIf P = NP or NPT then these languages can actually be efficiently decidable: every problem of this language that is not in P, NP or NPHW is equivalent as the problem to a problem in the languages NPHW or N", "label": 1, "id": 100774}
{"text": "we investigate the equal - mass 3-body system in general and in particular the motion of the two colliding planets. This is done for two different values of the planet-planet tidal strength, $Q_d$ = 1 and $Q_d$ = 1/3, and for different values of the impact parameter. These values of the impact parameters and the tidal strength are realistic for the planets of our solar system. For our study we have used the planet mass ratio equal to one, which is the best one for the 3-body problem. We have investigated numerically also the case of equal masses planets. The values of the constants entering $Q_s$ are chosen to be the same for all systems of planets.\n\nThe initial positions of the bodies are chosen randomly. The initial positions of the planets are given by the equation $z_j(s) = z_s\\omega(s)$, where $j=1,\\ldots,12$ is the initial planet number, $s$ is the distance along the orbit between two bodies, $\\omega(s)$ is a random distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma = \n0.1 $, and $z_s$ is a random number between $-1$ and +1, chosen uniformly. Figure \\[f-1\\] shows the initial configurations for three different mean values for $\\omega(s)$: one zero and two equal mean values with standard deviations 1 and 2. As an example, Figure \\[f-2\\] shows the initial configuration for the case $\\omega(s)\n= \\left\\{ \n\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & s\\; \\; \\mbox{is smaller than 50 km}, \\\\\n0.5 & s\\; \\; \\mbox{is equal 30 to 50 km},\n\\label{mixed}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$ where $s$ is the distance.\n\nFor small separation, the collision is not a hard one. The velocity vectors at the collision point are in general directed along the straight line between the centers of masses of the colliding bodies before the collision. However, when the separation reaches a value of some few $s_H$, this alignment is broken.\n\nAs a result of the collision, the bodies begin to fall towards each other. Figure \\[f-coll\\] shows the time evolution of the impact parameter for the collision of equal mass, $Q_d$=1/3, planets. The other planet-planet parameter which is used is, for simplicity, still the $Q_s$ parameter.\n\nAlthough the case considered in the simulation is an idealized one, and the number of planets in the system may be as small as three, or as large as 15 depending on their masses and other physical factors the time scales considered in the simulations are large enough to find results in agreement with our general theory. Some of the initial configurations (not shown here) have been chosen to demonstrate various possible situations. It is clear that the collisions are not perfectly elastic, as can be seen from the initial velocities of the bodies. As the velocities increase from zero to some finite value and the distance between the bodies increases or decreases, then the velocities decrease and their kinetic energy and the total energy transferred are greater, i.e. more complex physical effects such as damping and dissipation of energy are expected.\n\nThe simulation results for the collision of equal-mass asteroids are shown in Figure \\[f-coll\\] (thin lines). For systems with three or five planets in our solar system, the probability of a planet-planet collision with no other planet being present in the system is $\\sim$1%. In the same figure lines with thicker lines show for systems containing the Jupiter-Neptune system. In that case $P$ is increased to $\\sim$2%.\n\nWe see that the asteroid-planet collisions have the largest effect on planetary systems containing more than one planet. However, this increase in the collision probability is moderate and the effect of the collisions are not dramatic in other systems such as Jupiter-Neptune.\n\nWe have performed simulations using $Q_s$ = 1, and $Q_s$ = 1/3, but our conclusions do not depend on them, just as they do not depend either on using $Q_s$ = 3 or $Q_s$ = 5.\n\nWhen the distance between bodies $s\\sim s_H$ a transition occurs between the free fall and the hard body regime. The gravitational forces between the bodies and their internal forces are no longer negligible so that energy is transferred between the bodies.

We detail the observations and describe the reduction of the data. After discussing the results, we present a discussion of the implications of this work and the observational biases that affect this system. We adopt a standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with the matter density parameter $\\Omega_{m} = 0.27$ and the Hubble parameter $h = 0.741$ corresponding to a scale factor $a_{0} = 1$. Throughout this paper, we use the symbol \u00a0to label the model with a constant optical depth for radiation that is applied in Sections\u00a0\\[sec:dynamics\\] and \\[sec:reduction\\]. We discuss a number of issues at the interface between different observational domains and their observational implications in Section\u00a0\\[sec:implications\\].

It has been widely studied in the literature (@1993ApJ...405L.109T; @2002astro.ph..5530Z; @2005ApJ...629L..73M see Table \\[table:photometry\\]) and these include measurements of the Einstein ring radius, Einstein radius, and axis ratio ($b/a$). These data have been taken from a number of surveys, but these are typically of insufficient quality to measure the astrometric positions for the Einstein rings.\n\n###  {#section-1c22ee8ebd5edb4cfe1ece9d8fe3aeb25e}\n\nThe lens is at a redshift of $z_{l}=0.8$, again with a strong lens galaxy located at $z_{s}=1.59$ (see Table\u00a0\\[table:photometry\\]). The system is marginally resolved at arcsecond-separation, and therefore has also been studied by ground-based telescopes (@2003AJ....126.2517T; @2003ApJ...593..669T; @2003ApJ...582L..21J; @2004AJ....128..569O; @2007MNRAS.384L..56H). These include measurements of the Einstein radius, axis ratio or the lensed source, and the position angle at the minimum-resolving power of $0{\\farcs}1$. However, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:photometry\\], the source is extended along the line of sight at least out to the Einstein length, which constrains measurements of the source position, and any associated light deflection due to a caustic produced by the bright arc. The \u00a0data used in this work are from observations as part of the \u201cSternberg Survey Optical Lensing Program\u201d, taken between the dates of July 17th 2001, and August 15th 2002 under the conditions described in @2006AJ....132.1256L. This set of four data points were supplemented with three sets taken in 2002 for and, giving a total of nine data points. Two of these were taken under a cloud-based atmosphere, with the other seven taken on a clear night with the telescopes equipped with a filter. These data points were reduced in a similar manner to those described in. The uncertainties on the astrometric positions were calculated by performing a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the positions for each data point and using the uncertainty determined for each data point at that time as the error on the parameters in the subsequent fit. This process is repeated with each data point. The resulting uncertainties are conservative errors in the astrometric positions, and do not take into account systematic errors within the data, which we do not include in our analysis.\n\nReduced Astrometry {#section:analysis_obs_reduced_astrometry}\n-----------------\n\n###  {#section", "label": 1, "id": 100777}
{"text": "objectivethe aim if the study was to investigate whether children of older parents learn to make effective use of the available cognitive resources better than children of younger parents. If so, it may make it advisable to provide a formal educational or cognitive training programme for these children, which might be effective in improving their literacy and cognitive skills. The present study found a significant main effect of parental age on children's ability to decode words (d = 1.29). Children of 16-year-olds made more use of the available cognitive resources than children of 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds. There was no significant main effect of any of the family status variables considered (single, joint, or with grandparents) and none found in a previous study on this question (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27]).\n\nThe present result of main effects of parental age and family status is surprising. Two explanations are possible: First is the possibility of chance finding as a result of an unreliable test and, second is the possibility of the presence of differential effects according to the children's age or the family status of their parents, respectively (see also Roff, [@CR26]). Children of older parents or those who are living with grandparents have been shown to have reduced reading achievement, as compared to children with younger parents (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR28]; van den Boogerd, Roelofsen, and Trompenaars, [@CR31]; van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]; De Dreu et al., [@CR8]). It has been speculated that such children may have less support from family members, may have little influence in household tasks and may struggle more to express themselves independently, and consequently, may encounter more difficulties using the cognitive resources in reading and writing tasks (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27]; van den Boogerd, Roelofsen, and Trompenaars, [@CR31]; van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]). The present study did not find any significant difference of the results between children of parents 16 and those of parents 9. However, as we are the first to study the influence of parents' family status on the reading skills of their children, it is still to be shown whether the influence might be different in children living with grandparents compared with parents. The fact that the results of this study did not reveal that the quality of parents' support affects children's reading performance can be explained by the fact that we did not control for social environment and the quality of the parents' social support as such were not measured in this study. Additionally, the use of standardized scales to assess reading, oral reading, decoding and reading skills may contribute to more accurate assessment of reading skill. For all that, it also remains unclear whether such a relationship between children's socioeconomic status and reading ability has been found, as previous studies did not control for children's socioeconomic status while testing for children's reading ability (van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]; Eder et al., [@CR10]; Szecsko et al., [@CR29]). Our study found that children of 16-year-olds and older had a smaller decoding ability than children of younger parents, whereas other studies have found no difference in reading skills (van den Boogerd et al., [@CR31]; De Dreu et al., [@CR8]).\n\nThe main aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between children's socioeconomic status and their reading skills. The previous study by Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27] showed that single or joint parents made more use of the cognitive resources than married parents and that grandparents were more efficient in providing children with support than other family members. We expected that these factors would influence the relationship between maternal mental health and children's reading skills. We are, thus, also interested in whether the presence of a parent with a college/university education affects the relationship between maternal mental health and children's reading skills (Hobday, [@CR14]).\n\nThe present study provided new information on the relationship between family support, parental age, maternal mental health and children's reading skill.\n\nIn relation to family support, the current investigation found that children of parents 9 or older were more productive in using the available cognitive resources than children of parents in the lower age group (9 vs. 11; 9 vs. 16; 11 vs. 16). The family status variable showed no effect on children's decoding skills. The absence of any significant influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between mental health in mothers and children's decoding skills highlights that the relationship between parental education and child education is not related to their maternal employment status. The result is in accordance with Hobday ([@CR14]), who found no difference in children's academic achievement as related to either fathers' university/diploma or non-", "label": 1, "id": 100778}

We therefore stress that our modelling framework offers a novel approach to addressing the complexity of the dynamics of HIV treatment in real-life. It could help us to understand the complex interactions between other important factors that influence cure such as the number of sexual partners and viral load (or time since viral suppression), the effects of such factors on the HIV viral load, and the effects on social network structure \\[[@r30]\\].

In effect, they want to break away and form a new party.\"[16] The following day, the former New York City Council president told his listeners, \"A lot of folks are talking about what Stein said the other day, and why, when Wall Street was up against the wall they took away a lot of their money in a very ugly manner[,]\" and that their party \"is not a party that is in favor of big banks.\" He concluded by saying that \"it's nice to see so many people saying that[.]\"\n\nDespite this, and his claim of opposition to the Occupy Wall Street Movement, the party's New York City chapter has been working to support Occupy Wall Street: in addition to encouraging and giving financial support to Occupy Wall Street and the \"Occupy Wall Street movement,\" the local chapter has been supporting the Democratic National Convention protests.[17]\n\nIn early October, Stein and MoveOn's Andrew Kamin hosted a \"Labor Day Celebration\" in New York in which \"New York labor unions, which have been supportive of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, are the guests of honor. As labor rights groups nationwide have denounced Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's anti-union stance as a move to take jobs away from American workers, Stein and Kamin praised the Occupy Wall Street Movement for creating economic justice.\" The event was attended by approximately 200 labor leaders. A spokesman for the New York City chapter of the Communist Party of the United States and Canada said, \"The celebration was designed to support labor unions, that they had supported the Occupy Wall Street movement and in particular the demonstrations in other cities against Wall Street and the '1%.'\"[19]\n\nStein's position as an independent socialist left an opening for her to form and run in primaries. In October 2011 Stein had endorsed Joe Biden for president and had attended a fundraiser in support of his campaign, donating $200,000 to the New Hero Fund. In November 2012, a new endorsement was announced, and Stein donated an additional $200,000 to Biden.[20] She raised more than the amount that Biden had received in his previous two primary elections (with a minimum contribution of $500) and was reported to have received an infusion of money from wealthy donors and major left-leaning activist organizations.[20]\n\nDuring a campaign debate, Stein said that she would not be involved in third party presidential primaries, such as the Green Party's Jill Stein and the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson.\n\nIn April 2013, Stein became involved with the People's Republic Party US-Canada and pledged to support candidates from the party.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Jill Stein and the Working Families Party filed a lawsuit against Ohio and the Ohio Democratic Party asking them to overturn a state primary that excluded them. It was argued that because the state party excluded the Working Families Party's candidate for Ohio's 1st congressional district, Keith Rothfus, Stein and other potential candidates won no chance of becoming a party's nominee. The Ohio Supreme Court eventually tossed out the lawsuit on June 27, 2013 finding that the ballot access rules in Ohio were sound, in that they excluded candidates who did not have a chance of winning the nomination and were not in any manner fraudulent.[22][23] Stein and the Working Families Party celebrated the ruling, but the party is now focused on state primaries and not on winning the nomination in the next presidential election.[e]\n\nStein first came to national attention when she founded and launched an organization for those seeking the Democratic ticket for President and which would provide grassroots support for the presidential candidacy being run by then Senator Barack Obama.[24] Although named, the organization was not affiliated with Barack Obama. The organization had not obtained the official registration as a political party. Stein raised more than $10 million for the organization. She then chose to run in what is now Senator Obama's presidential campaign.\n\nBefore the 2008 election, Stein ran as the Democrat in New York State's 27th congressional district, covering the counties of Erie, Seneca, Lackawanna, Sullivan, and Tioga. This district is considered to be an \"open\" seat for Obama, since the Republican line is very strong, as this 27th district is largely in the North Central part of the county, although includes Erie County which voted for Romney by a wide margin. However, Stein faced many challenges in her run, including running against a strong incumbent Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin, who had been a member of the U.S. House for 24 years.

When Uber CEO Travis Kalanik took over as CEO in June 2016, it was clear his vision was to scale up and disrupt the car ownership industry.\n\nIn June 2015, he had the idea of building a similar system for ride hailing, allowing people to order a ride through their smartphones. But he had a big problem: he had heard that the cost for self-driving cars could be prohibitive. So he set about finding a way to make it affordable. But before he could find a solution, Uber acquired Jump, the e-hailing platform from former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, during its \"frenemy list\" period.\n\nThe acquisition left Uber facing a dilemma in how to make self-driving cars affordable. It was having trouble making cars, and it was also facing a regulatory nightmare in the U.S.\n\nUber's solution was to use its vast customer-satisfaction data to create an algorithm that would predict what drivers would do in extreme traffic conditions like when stopped for more than five minutes and in snowy weather. This would make a robot-like car driver more appealing in some cities.\n\nBut by the end of 2016, some of the key engineers left. To make the service profitable, the service had been reduced to a three-wheeled, autonomous-driving-through-cities service in certain cities.\n\n\"What happens in a few years is we get rid of the three-wheeled service, and we build a $15-a-minute service,\" Peyser says. The company will also sell its self-driving cars, and it is exploring the option of using the data to develop an AI that can autonomously park autonomous cars. Peyser says Tesla will never do this, because it never built a car that could drive itself at 15 miles per hour. \"We believe that self-driving will soon be cheap enough for all of us.

I think some reporters are like, \"I haven't seen the story we just wrote yet. That's bad!\" Some people say, \"Don't do that. It's bad form.\" I think someone was like, \"Is this story true or fake?\" That's when the real fun begins.\n\nDid you have to go to journalism school?No. I came to journalism by accident. I became a writer for a big-city news site in New York City. The owner was a terrible story editor, and I was like, What am I going to do about this? I had no experience as a journalist. It was like, \"That's a new gig.\" I took it and I fell right into it. It was great because my editors were awesome.

It was like stepping on a cloud.\n\nAfter you returned to The Daily Beast, what was the first job you had when you got back to the newsroom?I worked my way up to a little bit of everything. I started out as a fashion intern, then I was a digital editorial analyst. There's a whole network of things that people think you have to do but you don't.

The Paragon community is very vocal and passionate about their Paragon game, and they do love to have fun here. However, it\u2019s easy to dismiss the community if you just don\u2019t want to play their game. They\u2019ll bring you in, and then show you how to play Paragon. I\u2019m playing Paragon at a beginner or casual player level, so if you do enjoy playing Paragon, it\u2019s worth to play at that level. I\u2019ll be going into a lot more detail about how Paragon is the best game, but I want you to see first hand how the current changes in Paragon over the past year are making this the finest Paragon currently out there. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you there!\n\nIn other news, I\u2019ve been making big strides with the Paragon community. I\u2019ve released several big things over the last year, and today I\u2019m releasing a super-big big change: the Paragon \u2018backer\u2019 pack. You can still give everyone their very own Paragon booster, and those packs are going to be available in a pack sale starting April 19th. I always talk about the \u2018Paragon booster pack\u2019 and how you can use it for Paragon, but never do you get to actually buy one?

However, because of cost, lead is normally only an analytical tool in the context of pottery analysis, and does not represent the potential health threat posed by lead pollution from the combustion of fuel-based sources (e.g., petrol, wood-pellet boilers) in combination with wood charcoal (wastes, biomass residues) in the burning of earthenware pots.\n\n**Wood charcoal (wastes); biomass residues from wood burning.**\n\n**SOLID.**\n\n**POTATOES/MUSHROOMS.** The major cause of lead poisoning and associated deaths is from consumption of potatoes, which are often treated with lead glazes containing lead salts to retard mould growth (and reduce decomposition). However, as the potatoes accumulate lead, so too do their children (who also eat them unsupervised). Ingestion of small quantities of potatoes is no cause for alarm; it is, however, a cause for consideration. To obtain a diagnosis of lead poisoning, exposure, if any, should be corroborated by blood analysis of lead. Ingestion of a sufficient quantity will cause a lead toxicosis, such as hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and, in extreme cases, in the form of bone marrow failure. The threshold dose is highly variable from individual to individual, and may be calculated by a margin method or other methods (see Section 10.3). Ingestion of several hundred or 1000 milligrams of lead can cause symptoms and problems, even in the short term. (See also Figure 11.1 on page 130.)\n\nAlthough there is little or no public health benefit from consumption of lead glazed potatoes to prevent lead poisoning and related diseases, the main reason for cooking with lead is to reduce or delay lead contamination (which is unavoidable during cooking and preservation). Cooking of potatoes, in which lead occurs, is not a health risk even after two weeks as long as the glazes are not heated to the point at which they become lead glaze. However, prolonged consumption of a glazed and uncooked potato which still contains lead can cause serious problems.\n\nPotato consumption in China is often considered a health problem, but the evidence indicates little risk of the health consequences of eating lead-contaminated potatoes or of eating a food which has been prepared with lead glaze. In fact, because of a high rate of contamination with lead (as much as 0.1% lead in the fresh-cut potatoes), the health aspects of lead-contaminated food have become of increasing interest to both scientists and the general public. Lead in a potato is generally considered, therefore, as a minor health risk, and the most frequent cause of a hypercholostemic phenotype. However, the hypercholesterolaemic effects of lead are unknown. The American Heart Association (AHA) has described significant associations between occupational exposure to lead and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Lead can increase the risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), such as a reduced quality of life, difficulty with sleep and mood disorder. Even though there is a reduced quality of life associated with CVA, this is due to the risk factors of smoking and hypertension. Because of the lower levels of lead (than mercury or cadmium) in the human body, there is a possibility that any risks of lead poisoning are too small to worry about.\n\n### Fungicides/Viricides/Biocides/Antifungals\n\nThe chemicals used to control fungi and moulds can be divided into two major groups: organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals. Organic chemicals include compounds containing metals, such as copper, silver, or zinc (in the form of metal salts). Inorganic chemicals include nitrates, ammonium compounds, and compounds containing boron (B) or phosphorus (P).\n\n**_Chemicals to control fungal growth in wood, paper, glue, and textile fabrics._** Many fungi and moulds (including _Bipolaris_ ) produce enzymes that depolymerize or oxidize cellulose and other polymers (as well as some lignins and proteins) into sugar (sugars are not broken down; see Figure 2.8).

{"text": "Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious action movie from the front seat of a car on a desolate stretch of highway.\n\nI was recently in my second year of law school, one month into my second year. Since I have had one foot in and one foot out of law school for a decade, I feel like I've seen a lot more of my law school friends go through the same sort of process as I now am. During my first year, I had only three true friends in my class of ~250, and during second year, only one. This year, we count the number of friends in a class of 3,700.\n\nI feel pretty confident that there are more people whose experience I don't know and I don't want to know anything about. But I still wonder if I could have had the first \"real\" friend in my freshman year.\n\n\"First\" I would say, but then I don't know because, once again, I am not there yet. But, to the point. I know. But I don't know because, I don't know. I have to remember to always be first.\n\nI remember so clearly a conversation with my partner one night regarding the subject of the first real relationship. He said \"I'm not sure what he wants to do now that his girlfriend left him\". I don't remember exactly what he said, but my mind immediately went to where I thought he'd be doing.\n\nThen, when I went to law school, I remember sitting in my first course, where I was assigned to take a first course and was supposed to teach it for two hours. I was given the assignment and, on that course, the teacher spoke to the class about what we would learn in three weeks. He said something like, \"You're going to do research in three weeks; you're working on an issue and you'll be called upon to make a decision about it within two weeks\". My class was asked, \"What're you doing for three weeks?\" I just said yes and gave them my answer and then proceeded to study as if they hadn't asked me anything. I know how the assignment ended and I still don't remember what it was. So, at that point, I feel like I don't know the whole story. So, I guess I would say, if I were asking myself, \"what did I really want?...\" then I would say, \"to have a real relationship at the end of my second year\". I know I want to spend my third year of law school with my first real friend in my second year.\n\nI've always been an early bird. I can't complain or complain that I didn't get any sleep, though. The only thing they did to take advantage of me was that I had to do 10 minutes of practice with them, and then five minutes with my partner. That's why the first time they ever gave me my own private room, they wanted to get me to practice with them. They were so arrogant in how they treated me that day. They had a practice session every day with a different partner. So, I had to practice with one partner, and then the other partner had to practice with me. They could play around with it all they wanted, but I didn't want any practice because, it could have been more. I know the story well...it was something my mother had told me when, out of the blue, she said something about why I would be a lawyer, but never the actual reason...because I never learned anything for myself, because I never studied. I studied what I was taught to study; I wanted to learn that. I started out the year I signed up in November of 2009, the second year I started law school. I didn't realize it would be so hard because I was too scared to do anything different. I was afraid if I did the time would pass and then I wouldn't have the time. I didn't know the first few months of law school would be so hard to start. When I first started school, it seemed like it would be easy, but it only seemed like that because I had been around the same people my entire life, and I always did well. I was going to finish law school and then get a job right away. After graduation, I'd be working in the city. But now, here I am, trying to figure out what I want to do, how I want to spend my free time, and how I want to handle the transition that I'm going through.\n\nI really don't know. I remember when I was a law student, I thought I might go into criminal law. I did well on the MCAS exam in the first two years, and I was really scared to go to the actual trial. But then I realized, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I remembered the second year of law school when I was so confused and was asked what the", "label": 1, "id": 100789}

The incidence and mortality of EC increased sharply over the past few decades. In some industrialized nations, the incidence of EC has tripled over the past three decades. Most ECs present in patients as localized, superficial tumors, and the vast majority is treated successfully by surgery with curative intent: total (or near-total) esophagectomy with the Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (TL) procedure, extended mediastinal dissection, lymphadenectomy, or combined chemo-radiotherapy in curative intention or palliation. An increasing number of patients suffer from metastatic disease at diagnosis resulting in poor outcome. The median survival rate is 16 months with median time to recurrence between 2 and 3 years. Patients with resectable disease have an excellent outcome if they are staged appropriately. Staging of the primary tumor is important because it allows proper staging of the disease and may also be associated with a change in treatment.

When both moved to Glasgow for a post-graduate research-only degree, they began working together at Glasgow Life, where they\u2019ve become the poster children for the city\u2019s \u201ccultural capital\u201d.\n\nGlasgow is a city of culture. But not everyone has a cultural \u2018heart.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s here, says David Bell, convener of the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission (CCCC), where Glasgow really steps up when it comes to supporting cultural creatives in the city.\n\nA city that is so busy with economic growth, it seems that if only cultural creatives (CCCs) were granted some space in its cultural economy, Glasgow would do them the world of good. Bell has argued that Glasgow\u2019s \u2018cultural heart\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be seen as a thing: It\u2019s a state.\n\nGlasgow, a city where many might argue that the cultural heart doesn\u2019t exist, is being made an international \u2018cultural capital\u2019 by the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission. Their aim is to commission an internationally consistent scheme of awards to reward their city\u2019s cultural creatives, with a global, national and local dimension.\n\nFor Glasgow 2014, which is this week, the initiative came about as a result of a call through Facebook for proposals for celebrating Glasgow 2014\u2019s cultural assets \u2013 to create some award scheme that can be a \u2018celebration\u2019 rather than a \u2018competition\u2019.\n\nMore than 300 Glasgow-based cultural creatives have written to the CCC asking for proposals, and Bell said it had \u201ctaken some inspiration\u201d from his earlier work with the UEA and the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Tourism Society (GCTS) to \u2018build on all the goodwill we\u2019ve had with them\u2019, creating an award scheme that wouldn\u2019t be judged, \u201cbut celebrated and recognised across the city\u201d.\n\nThis week, the commission is officially unveiling the first of several schemes designed to celebrate the city\u2019s unique cultural assets.\n\nAnd there are two very different versions of this scheme \u2013 with different aims, even with different forms.\n\nAn all-Celtic, all-the-time award\n\nThe Celtic Alliance\n\nAt Glasgow 2014, Glasgow\u2019s ethnic and cultural heritage is celebrated by the Celtic Alliance. This is an \u2018all-Celtic, all-time award scheme\u2019.\n\nThe CCC has already been criticised for awarding an \u2018all-Celtic, all-time award\u2019 to Glasgow\u2019s Calton Hill and for not acknowledging the diverse Glasgow\u2019s ethnic communities. To do this, the award scheme has been re-branded.\n\nAt a meeting in Glasgow\u2019s City Chambers last week, delegates to CCC outlined the \u2018new\u2019 scheme, with an award of \u2018Celtic Cultural Heritage\u2019 at a Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.

A council spokesman confirmed that \u201cthe new scheme was chosen because it is already recognised in culture; people recognise it and it\u2019s easily recognisable\u201d.\n\nThere is a lot riding on this contest.\n\nThe awards are intended to be \u201cthe largest and most culturally, culturally diverse awards programme in the UK\u201d \u2013 and in addition to an \u2018all-Celtic, all-time award\u2019 also, \u201cthere is a large and very wide range of awards across all categories, from the Scottish Community Awards through to the CCC.\u201d\n\nThe commission is committed to using existing awards to promote all Glasgow\u2019s cultural assets, including \u201ccelebrating Scottish and local, international and regional arts talent as a whole, rather than focusing on cultural assets\u201d. The CCC said that the award is designed to \u201cencourage more creativity across the city\u201d.\n\nThe scheme is funded by the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Tourism Society (GCTS), the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission, Glasgow City Council and a \u00a3700,000 grant from the Royal Academy of Dance: all three local-level arts groups.\n\nThe initiative is backed \u2013 crucially \u2013 by a very clear, strong and clear plan.

{"text": "cross - linking of corneal collagen ( cxl ) is more efficient than the formation of croslite. However, to form croslip, the cells that are in the croslite must form a bridge. If the lumen surface, that which the cells are in contact and thus to adhere, has an irregular or jagged surface, then a bridge will not form and the cell will not adhere. Instead, the cell surface itself will jut out creating a ridge or crescenetto. Cells that form croslip are then forced to move to form a new crosle in order to renew the corneal collagen. In cases of the presence of scar from previous eye cataract surgery, then there is a period of time in which the scar tissue will hold the cells that are forming a crosle in a crescenetto pattern.\n\nA number of cell surface adhesion molecules have been shown to be crucial in the formation of croslip. Integrins are cell-surface adhesion molecules on the endothelial and epithelial cells of the corneal epithelium. A number of genes have been associated with the ability to create croslip. The integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18) has been associated and shown to be crucial in the formation of croslip. The integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18) is linked to formation of croslip. Thus croslip can form in the presence of integrin a3b1 (CD11b/ CD18). Croslip formation in the presence of this protein is not as complete as it is in the presence of integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18).\n\nFormation of a crosle occurs more in the presence of CD11b/CD18 and integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18).\n\nFormation of a crosle can be studied using an in vivo animal model, such as the Lewis rat. This means that this study of croslip formation is not just the presence or the absence of croslip; it is an assessment of the process that occurs to build a new crosle. The cells in this crosle have to migrate so that the new crosle can occur. In the study of croslip for glaucoma using this model, the integrin CD11b/CD18 was found to be involved in this migration. In order to further understand the role of CD11b/CD18 integrin on cell migration and scarring during glaucoma, this study investigated the CD11b/CD18 protein, integrins (a2b1 and a3b1), the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 2 and 8) and the tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP).\n\nThe CD11b/CD18 protein, integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18), and the integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18) have been identified in previous studies. As CD11b/CD18 has been shown previously to be involved in the migration of corneal endothelial cells, corneal fibroblasts, and in the formation of croslip, it was studied if CD11b/CD18 is involved in the migration of corneal epithelial cells and glaucoma cells that form scar. In this study it was investigated and found that CD11b/CD18 is most important during the migration of corneal epithelial cells. CD11b/CD18 is also important in migration of corneal fibroblasts. CD11b/CD18 and integrins (a2b1 and a3b1) were shown to be important for cell migration, and CD11b/CD18 integrin was shown to be more important that a3b1 in cell migration. In addition, CD11b/CD18 and a2/b1 were shown to be important in migration of corneal endothelial cells.\n\nThe collagen of the cornea has previously been shown to have two types of fibers, the type I collagen as well as the type II collagen.\n\nHowever, there are now two types of collagen that are currently known, i.e., collagen IV in the endothelial cells as well as in the epithelial cells and collagen VI in the stromal cells of the human cornea.\n\nCollagen IV in the endothelial cells of the human cornea is similar to collagen I in the corneal stroma.\n\nIn the endothelial cells of the human cornea, it is found as type IV.\n\nIn the corneal epithelial cells, the protein that is produced by these cells is similar to type I collagen.

This is a darkly comedic tale of the miseries we face every day when we take control of our own lives.\n\nTitanic Town opened last fall as part of the New York Public Theater\u2019s new Main Stage series, and for the first time a theatrical performance of the play was televised live on NYC\u2019s WNYC-TV.\n\nJonathan Larson, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning plays The Silver Star and Other Plays and A Thousand Streets Under the Sea, is best known for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim on the stage musicals Into the Woods and Saturday Night. But he has shown a knack for writing songs, and his songs have been used as the soundtrack for movies from \u201cToy Story\u201d to \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d This is the second time Larson has written and directed a play for the NYC theatre, having done So, in 2008 and Sondheim Interrupted in 2005 (both were staged by the New York Shakespeare Festival). It was also the last time a play was performed live in front of a live audience, a tradition the new musical tries to change by broadcasting the action on a public television station.\n\nDespite its dark subject matter, Titanic Town doesn\u2019t seem depressing. In it, a group of young urbanites in New York\u2019s Lower East Side become fascinated by a series of mysterious \u201cdreamscapes,\u201d hallucinations of life lived out in the city by a pair of young women. After some experimentation it becomes clear to the group that each of them suffers from a form of \u201ctransparency,\u201d a term popularly used to describe the phenomenon of seeing through someone else\u2019s eyes, or experiencing another\u2019s personality in your head.

{"text": "background : the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three commercially available plant extracts (Dulong, Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang) in reducing urinary incontinence. According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, these products can help to relieve urinary tract and gynecological symptoms. The study subjects were 200 persons (aged between 15-65) with an average age of 36.0\u00b110.3. The clinical symptoms were measured using the International Continence Society (ICS). Patients were evaluated in 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Each of the subjects was randomly assigned to one of the three groups treated with 3 gm of powder of Dongxihuang, Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang three times a day for 3 months. In order to examine the difference between pre and other three months, urine was collected for laboratory analysis and was tested using the three groups combined. There was no significant difference after treatment between the D and Y groups, and between the D and Y&G groups (p>0.05), while there was significant difference between the D and Y&G groups (p<0.05). It was the same for the D and Y&W groups (p<0.05). The improvement of ICS score was significant between D and D&W after treatment, D and G after treatment, D and Y&G after treatment (p<0.05). Three groups could reduce symptoms significantly (p<0.05), and it could be concluded that the effect of Dongxihuang and a combination of Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang was better than that of the other three drugs combined together. The combined treatment with D and Y would promote urination and decrease urine production. Combined treatment with D and Y&W and D&W would promote urination and decrease urine production and urination, and could cause lower urinary tract symptom. The effect of Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang were better than that of the single drugs, and the combination of Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang could reduce the symptoms more effectively.", "label": 1, "id": 100794}

{"text": "Uploaded By: Red_Riot Uploaded: Mar 30, 2016 Sign in to vote An earlier version of this article was published with slightly different data.\n\n\n\nWhen the original version of this infographic published, it was missing one of the more eye-catching graphics in my opinion.\n\nThe graphic depicting the number of homicides and killings in the United States in 2009 was a bit of a curiosity as it was more than likely an accident. That graphic had a rather strange shape that was only slightly more interesting than a rectangle.\n\nThe image depicting the number of homicides and killings in the United States in 2009 was more interesting than a rectangle\n\nI had my suspicions, of course, and so when I saw the graphic showing number of murders across the United States on a map, I decided to take a closer look at it. The map turned out to be an interesting graphic in and of itself.\n\nThe map shows several different data components that are useful in understanding how mass killings are distributed across the country. There are several layers that make up this graphic, and they are separated by colored dots.\n\nThe first layer, the bottom layer on the map, is drawn on a black background. The top-right corner is a white line. In the bottom left corner is a larger white dot. The large white dot tells us that we are looking at a state or an entire region of a state.\n\nIn the background are red and pale green contours that show the location of homicides. They are contours that depict the locations of homicides. There are dots in the middle of the contour shapes \u2014 those black dots \u2014 that are the centers of the state\u2019s homicides. The centers of those black dots are the locations of homicides by year.\n\nThe green dot in the upper left corner is at the center of the state and is the center of homicides by year.\n\nThe dark green contours that intersect those dots are mapped out as states of the state and the states represent the number of homicides that occurred in 2009. The color gradient from black to pale green represents the number of homicides that occurred in each state year by year.\n\nThe middle left corner is a blue shape that is a circle that represents the murders that occurred between 1999 and 2009. They are areas of the United States that are not homicides but which are shown by being shown as murders.\n\nThe uppermost horizontal line is also drawn as a circle representing the murders that occurred within the United States \u2014 the state and the region.\n\nThe second layer on the map is a shape that fills out just the top of the country and that starts off as a red dot. The shape is a black arc at the top left of the country. It represents the percentage of murders by state and year that occur in that state.\n\nIn the United States, all the red areas represent murders that occurred in the entire country in the year and all the black areas represent murders that occurred within the U.S.\n\nThe last three layers on the map are the colored dots that are drawn on by the colored circles. They are called clusters of clusters. Those clusters of clusters represent clusters of homicides that are mapped out based upon state and year, and they are drawn in green, blue, or red. The two clusters of clusters that represent large clusters of homicides that occurred in 2009 are in red and in yellow.\n\nIn 2009, there were four clusters of clusters on this map.\n\nTwo clusters of clusters \u2013 the yellow cluster in the upper left corner on the first layer of the map and the red cluster of clusters on the third and fourth layers of the map \u2013 were clusters drawn from the cluster of clusters located at the center of each of those clusters. These two clusters of clusters represent the second largest cluster of clusters at the top of the color of the clustering and they were drawn in red.\n\nThe third cluster of clusters that is in purple on the first layer in the lower right corner consists of clusters that occurred in a handful of states but that were drawn in the center of large clusters that occurred in more than two states. It is drawn in blue. The fourth cluster of clusters \u2013 red, in the top left corner on the third layer \u2013 represents a cluster of clusters that also occurred in a handful of states but drew in the center of clusters of clusters that occurred in more than two states.\n\nWhat these clusters of clusters show is that for every state that is mapped out, there is another cluster of clusters that covers just a portion of the total homicides in that state. When those clusters of clusters are drawn, they can occur across one state if it is mapped out and they are called clusters of clusters.\n\nHere are the clusters of clusters that are drawn for every state:\n\nCluster 1 \u2013 State # 1 \u2013 Cluster of clusters State # 2 \u2013 State # 2 State # 3 \u2013 State # 3 Cluster # 2 State # 3 - State # 3 Cluster # 3 State # 4 \u2013", "label": 1, "id": 100796}

The results revealed no significant difference of m.i.f. assay and the serum and urine pth-33 immunoradiometric assays between the two groups. The serum pth-23 and m.i.f. assay were the best predictors of PTH level in the univariate analysis. However, in the multivariate analysis, the serum pth-23 immunoradiometric assay was the most reliable predictor of PTH level. The serum pth-35 was the highest (r = 0.917), m.i.f. assay was the next (r = 0.895) and urine pth-36 was the lowest (r = 0.864) with respect to the area under curve (p = 0.001). The results suggest that the pth-23, pth-31 and pth-33 immunoradiometric assays and the serum pth-33 immunoradiometric assays have a good correlation with the serum intact PTH concentrations in patients with multiple system atrophy. The serum pth-35 and m.i.f. assay, and the urine pth-36 immunoradiometric assay were the best predictors to PTH levels in the whole group. No significant difference in PTH value was detected between the two groups by any of three pthassays, or by the percentage of patients with higher PTH value. However, no case with negative PTH results also had elevated pth values and four cases with elevated PTH results had normal serum pth values. Serum and urine pth assays had no significant difference between patients in one group and patients in another. Our results suggest that the measurement of intact PTH concentrations with the two pth assays (i.e. serum and urine pth-33, pth-35 and pth-36) are suitable for their prediction in patients with multiple system atrophy.", "label": 1, "id": 100797}
{"text": "Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant in the United States, even if there is no proof that it will lead to the end of democracy in America. The argument was made by Professor Richard Wolff, a former chief economist for the World Bank, now at George Mason University, based on his analysis of a wide range of sources of the income statistics used in the United States. These analyses, he found, did not indicate a consistent relationship between the level of household income and the level of democracy.\n\nHe noted that the statistical methods used by the World Bank were flawed, and that much of the income-equality data and arguments on which economists of different persuasions based their analyses were misleading or flawed. The conclusions were made by leading figures in the profession, some of them among the most respected. There was also the problem that much of the research on income inequality in the United States was based on the surveys that were collected by the Income and Wealth project of the Center of Income Dynamics (CID) at the University of Michigan. For some years, that survey, which was run by the Institute for Social Research at Princeton University, had been collecting data on income and wealth. The authors of a recent article in the Review of Income and Wealth, published by the same organization, claimed that this survey was \u201cmore rigorous than the most recent Census survey.\u201d The authors went on to criticize the Income and Wealth project for the use of non-standard approaches and other problems.\n\nIn response to these attacks on their work, the authors of the Review went on to say that non-standard methods are needed when surveying the behavior of the wealthiest, which includes many of the most well-off segments of American society. If those surveys are flawed methods, which they conceded would be the case, then the statistical analyses based on the survey should be considered unreliable. The analysis of the survey relied on a technique of regression analysis to show \u201cthat the standard measures of income inequality \u2013 the Gini index and the top and bottom quintiles \u2013 were closely linked to each other and to the distribution of individual income.\u201d Such methodology should not be used as a basis for political debate, the authors suggested, but their own conclusion was that other methods were not sufficient.\n\nThe authors of the Review also criticized Wolff for his conclusions based on the analysis of various sources of income. Wolff rejected that criticism, concluding that the criticisms were based on cherry-picking, since their arguments did not apply to many sources he examined.\n\nThe fact is that Wolff\u2019s criticisms of the income-statistics methods used by the World Bank were not based on a critique of the methodology, but on a critique of the conclusions drawn from those methods. What was missing in those analyses was \u201ca broad cross-national study of incomes that also examined the political institutions that give the richest, most powerful country in the world its most powerful democratic state, and also a cross-national survey of the relationship of income and social mobility in these countries.\u201d\n\nWolff\u2019s analysis focused primarily on Germany, Britain and the U.S. His evidence was based on data from the surveys of the center of income dynamics conducted by the survey research institute of Princeton University. Wolff and his co-authors then made some adjustments to bring the data into the form most favorable to conclusions favorable to them. The resulting figures supported their argument.\n\nSome of the information used in the analysis of U.S. poverty, however, which was provided by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago, was based on estimates of a measure called the poverty measure of family income. This measure is based on different assumptions from that used to determine poverty, and was based on different questions that might not be found in every country. According to the University of Chicago report, \u201cthe poverty income measure has been criticized on several grounds. One of the criticisms is that by requiring families to have the same size, number, and age composition it produces families with markedly different living standards which in turn produces misleading conclusions in the analysis.\u201d\n\nWolff criticized the use of U.S. poverty as \u201ca poor substitute for the European measures because poverty indicators in Europe have much higher correlations with democracy. But it [the U.S. poverty indicator] makes a more powerful claim \u2013 that income inequality is the primary cause of democratic dysfunction.\u201d He also pointed to U.S. studies carried out by the Bureau of Economic in-stitution which indicated that \u201cthere has been only a weak correlation between incomes and levels of democracy.\u201d\n\nWhile such criticisms were made to the extent that it was useful for the argument \u2013 that the United States was not a democracy \u2013 they did not constitute an analysis of the relationship between income inequality and democracy, and, therefore, does not support the conclusions of the authors who produced these statistics and criticized Wolff for drawing conclusions from them.\n\nIn the introduction to his article,", "label": 1, "id": 100798}

The study sample included patients with age related hearing loss and the control group consisted of subjects without age related hearing loss. Both patient groups took part in a self -report scale of depression. It was found that the level of depression was higher in patients with age related hearing loss compared to subjects without age -related hearing loss. The increase in depression level correlated with hearing loss duration. The highest level of depression in comparison to subjects without age related hearing loss was found in patients with stage 3 hearing loss.\n\nAim : To examine the psychomotor performances of patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia compared to healthy subjects. The participants had type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia and were age matched to healthy subjects. They took part in a computerized and a pen-and-paper test battery that included the Stroop colour word test, Trail making test A and B, digit span test A and B, and Rey auditory verbal learning test. It was found that patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia had significantly slower psychomotor performance compared to healthy subjects. However, there was no significant difference in psychomotor performance in patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia compared to healthy subjects in terms of their Stroop colour word or Trail making A and B.\n\nAim : To describe the short form 36 (SF-36) health survey of patients with chronic hepatitis C and to examine the relationship between the variables in the survey and psychological factors. The study population was selected from patients who were attended in two clinics affiliated to the Department of Internal Medicine of a state hospital. The SF36 health survey was given to all the participants who gave informed consent. Of the 50 participants, 31 (62%) were hepatitis C positive and 19 (38%) were hepatitis C negative. The demographic and clinical data of the subjects were recorded. The SF36 survey was administered. Descriptive statistics were used to study the mean. The study was a cross-sectional survey of all patients with chronic hepatitis C; therefore, a correlation test was done and the t -test (independent variables and dependent variables, respectively) was used to evaluate the strength of the significant results. The results obtained in this cross sectional survey demonstrated that the subjects had good health status and high social support scores. However, low scores in physical health were noted. Also, there was no significant correlation between disease severity and the SF36 summary data or any of the questions in the survey.\n\nPurpose : The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of migraine in patients with thyroid disorders. Materials & Methods : A total of 474 patients with thyroid disorders were selected and studied using a questionnaire with three parts and two sections. Of the 474 patients, there were 220 (48%) males and 244 (52%) females with a mean age \u00b1 SD of 41.3 \u00b1 17.3 years. Also, 50 (11%) patients had migraine and 46 (10%) patients had other types of primary headaches. Results : Among the patients with thyroid disorders without headache, 54 (11%) migraine and 50 (12%) with other primary headache types. Among the patients with thyroid disorders with headache, 17 with migraine (35%) and 15 with other primary headache types (30%). Conclusions : Migraine is a headache type with a high prevalence among patients with thyroid disorders without headache. Therefore, migraine should be a high priority for investigation regarding the pathophysiological mechanism, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPurpose : The aim of this study was to detect the presence of the Y chromosome using a commercial kit; a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the DNA of a specific Y chromosome segment in the plasma of patients with testicular tissue hypoplasia (TTXHA). Materials & Methods : From September to November 2016, blood samples were collected to be analyzed by PCR for detecting the Y chromosome in the patients with TTXHA (n = 22). A total of 42 samples were also analyzed for the presence of the Y chromosome in the case control study groups; 22 patients with TTXHA, 22 patients with testicular cancer and 20 controls (patient that have received orchiopexy or cancer patients, age range was 5-70 years-old). Results : The male patients with TTXHA were found to have 2% (2/22) and female patients with TTXHA were found to have 14.9% (2/14) positive plasma samples. In the case control study group, a total of 13 patients with TTXHA, 13 patients with testicular cancer and 12 controls were analyzed; of them, a total of 1% (1/13 patients with TTXHA) and 12.5% (2/12 patients with TTXHA) were positive for the Y chromosome.

{"text": "This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch. I loved the dancing on the moving train. We have a few of these dance films on the Biograph disc, but they aren't in as good a condition, and the subjects in them are rather dull. The action in this one is just too funny. Not knowing much about trains, I had a little trouble following everything about the switch that was going on while they moved from New York to Washington! The ending was the best. The film seems to have been preserved in a bad (almost) print, which made every lighted scene very grainy, and made for an overall \"darkish\" presentation. I can't complain, though. If it had been a better copy, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. I found myself laughing out loud at the dance footage, and really feeling for the young girl in the carriage. Her reaction to being told that everyone on the carriage is going to have the night off was great! I'll have to keep the lookout for another film on trains.\nI also watched a 35mm. print of Charles Dickenson's 1913 film The Seventh Day. Although it's from 1913, it seems to have more recent qualities to it- something that I think is unique to Biograph films- which is that everything seems larger. Maybe it's because of the graininess that I noticed a difference between that and the usual standard of film from the same time period. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching the film, and was impressed with the special effects. It was a great story too. Although I would have liked to see more, it was good to just watch the scenes that were available without interruption. It's very hard for me to say what else I liked about it, because there are a lot of good things to say about it. I enjoyed the beginning when the father is writing his will and his wife has to leave the house. Of course, the \"real\" wife ends up coming back, but with the daughter instead!\nAt least I know that both of the films I watched are going to end up being reels from this collection.\nFor whatever reasons, I always enjoy watching the comedy shorts more than the other Biograph films. I must say though, this isn't the strongest of them all. I don't know what it is, but just as I am enjoying the scene with the little boy being tutored, his father comes to the door, and interrupts the scene. Not that things couldn't have been interupted, but there just doesn't seem to be a nice way to end the scene. The little boy was just so cute though! The main scene on the street was great too, and I was glad to watch it again as well. The father was quite funny. The scene in the garden was nice too. There was some very good camerawork in this particular film, and I enjoyed watching it again.

All you need to know.\nSnapchat has been growing rapidly since its launch in 2011 but until the IPO many analysts said there was too much uncertainty around its business for it to be regarded as a growth technology stock.\nBut at the end of March 2017, Snapchat changed its prospectus to allow itself up to $1 billion (\u00a3827) of shares to be floated.\nSince then Snap's shares have risen more than 50% - putting it ahead of the likes of Twitter and Facebook.\nIn 2016, 41% of all advertising spending on social networks, was on Facebook - most of this being on Facebook's own platform. Snapchat received only 0.6% of the total advertising spend on social networking sites - and Facebook now wants some of that to be on its own platform rather than third-party apps.\nSnapchat's IPO could raise $53.1m (\u00a345.1m) at an estimated valuation of $24bn (\u00a320.2bn), according to the Financial Times.\nMajor investors in Snapchat include Tiger Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital.\nSnapchat has been criticized for what users perceive to be its closed nature to developers - preventing them creating their own applications built on its API but also because it refuses to share user data, and prevents users from saving videos from their account to their phone.\nAlthough these could be seen as advantages to the company, it could also make some of the larger tech firms think twice about entering agreements with Snapchat's parent, Snap, Inc.", "label": 1, "id": 100802}

{"text": "In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction at the end of the power stroke and enters the cylinder to complete the power stroke. This reversal reduces the time the steam spends in the cylinder, allowing it to increase the time steam spends at high temperature and high pressure for better steam engine work.\nIn some types of engines, the steam does not change direction, it simply moves into an adjacent cylinder to be used again in the next power stroke. As the piston and steam are in different cylinder in the next stroke, no reversal of the direction of the steam is necessary.\nIt is common to have multiple cylinders in one bank of power pistons. In some designs, the first piston in the bank reverses the steam. The steam then moves into the next cylinder, also part of the bank, where it continues to expand, driven by pressure from the steam in the two previous cylinders. The steam moves in succession from the first cylinder to the second to the third, and is exhausted in the last cylinder. When the engine is working at full speed, each cylinder only sees steam from the previous cylinder. It does not see the fresh supply from the nozzle until the steam has had time to expand in the cylinder. It is common to have more cylinders in this design than in the previous one, but the method is the same.\nIt is also common to build two sets of cylinders with the same number of cylinders. As in the case of one bank of cylinders, the steam is supplied to cylinder 1, then moves to cylinder 2, then cylinder 3, and so forth. In this case, a bank of two cylinders is installed, one behind the other. Piston 1 is always on piston 1. The steam enters cylinder 1 for the first half of the power stroke expansion, then moves to cylinder 2 for the rest of the stroke. When the engine is at full speed, cylinders 3 and 4 will see steam from cylinders 2 and 1 during this engine cycle.\nIt is also important to take account of the space constraints for steam engines. For an engine with six cylinders, it would be possible to have one set of three cylinders all in one bank of power cylinders. You could have three cylinders, one in the front and one on each side of the front two cylinders. The first cylinder would work on half the stroke, then when it was working on the first part of the power stroke, both cylinders on the same side together and then both the rear pistons together. In this case, the steam will travel the space between cylinders three and four, as well as from the front cylinder to the rear cylinders. The engine must be sufficiently long, with plenty of space between cylinders.\nFinally, it must be said that some steam engines have only one steam cylinder. Some are even two-stroke engines. In this case, the steam reverses or not to reverse as necessary (or not) for the application.", "label": 1, "id": 100804}
{"text": "In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese, but with enough good moments to make this an average episode overall. I'm glad I watched the series in three seasons, as to avoid having to endure such dreck when it could have been avoided.\nThe title refers to something the young woman, the daughter of the murdered minister, says in response to the questioning of one of the detectives. She claims that her mother is alive, and that the woman, who she has seen in secret, has the power to tell the good from the bad and to reveal the truth to everybody else.\nThere's some good stuff here, like the fact that the police try to find the witnesses to the crimes and question them. I like it that they actually go door-to-door, just like what they did in the old days of the series, when there weren't any computers.\nWe also get to watch an interrogation of a suspect by one of those famous detectives, who is good at his work, and who seems to be an expert in the field. I'm not sure if his name is mentioned in this episode, however, but he's clearly a famous guy, and I like seeing him in action.\nThe episode contains one scene where a suspect tries to frame one of the investigators. Of course, this is done in a way that leaves a clear trail, and where he isn't entirely successful in covering up for himself. Still, it's fun to see the detective in action, who is quick enough to uncover the lies and eventually finds his way.\nThe whole series works perfectly fine if you just try to forget the first two seasons, and you keep your expectations to a minimum.

{"text": "The university experienced its share of student unrest during the Vietnam War in the 1970s.\nNevertheless, the student body remained remarkably politically inactive through the Nixon years. Only in the mid-1980s did students begin to express themselves as an organized political force. A presidential commission, established by Harvard University during the Nixon-Kissinger years, recommended the creation of an \"academic community.\" The idea was to encourage students, faculty, and staff to express their individual as well as collective identities and to create an integrated, rather than segregated, academic community.\nIn 1987 student petitions resulted in the creation of a Committee on Racial and Ethnic Affairs, which monitored the representation of underrepresented groups in classes and employment. Faculty members voted to institute a program of hiring in racial and ethnic \"diversity.\" In the spring of 1989, an unranked faculty-initiated strike occurred around faculty wage demands and the university's need to hire permanent faculty to fill vacant positions. Students and faculty expressed fear that new programs and services intended to achieve minority recruitment would adversely affect standards, and called for greater faculty involvement in review. In 1990, the university established an Assistant Provost for Academic Support. The purpose of the initiative was to increase academic support services to disadvantaged students and to raise standards for the recruitment of students enrolled in a variety of nontraditional admission programs. Since 1980, the university has made a special effort to recruit underrepresented students. In 2003, the university launched a $2.3-billion endowment campaign. African American, Jewish, Asian Pacific Islander, and Latino students received an average of $890 million annually from grants and scholarships provided by the federal government, state governments, and private organizations. In 1998, Latinos enrolled at the university received $11.8 million in federal student aid monies. In addition to offering 43 scholarships to historically black colleges and universities in the 2001\u20132002 academic year, the university contributed almost $1 billion to African American students nationwide in the same academic year. In 1999 the university announced an addition of 12 new programs to its 280-degree program. The programs were designed for students who do not want to attend college full time. These programs require two years in either the military or a community college while at the same time satisfying certain requirements needed for a degree from the university.\nThe university has 22 graduate and professional schools. Its 18 museums and the extensive University Library System are key resources for research and scholarly work. The library system is regarded as the largest academic library in the United States and the fourth largest library in the world. The libraries hold over 15 million volumes on 11.9 million volumes of shelving. The University Archives collection documents the institution's history, including the records of the early presidencies and those of faculty, administrators, committees and their subcommittes, organizations, and departments.\nDartmouth has a large international student population, with 13 percent of students coming from Africa, Asia, South America, Central America, or the Caribbean. In 1995\u20131996 Dartmouth had a total enrollment of 4,950 undergraduate students and 2,360 graduate students. The university operates its own television stations, radio stations, and an off-campus farm.

The mission of the Kline Farm was to provide an inclusive and nurturing environment where children of all races and creeds could participate actively in all aspects of farm life.\nThe Kline Farm began with 26 African American children and was directed by Mrs. Faye H. Wilson. In 1963, she assumed all responsibilities for direction and leadership of the farm. The 50 children attending the Kline Farm were cared for by 7 women with an average age of 30. The children ranged in age from 6 months to 17 years. Each of the women lived at the Kline Farm, worked at one of the local stores, and attended Hidden Hills Baptist Church with 2 of the women serving as the church organist and pianist.\nWilson worked with the state on implementing the child and adult food stamp program for the farm and in 1964, the Kline Farm was the first farm in the United States to be approved as an adult food stamp project. The state approved $475 a year to feed the 50 children daily. This was one the first food assistance programs serving any rural area in Dade County. In 1965, the child food stamp program became state law with the Kline Farm participating as well.\nIn 1968, the Kline Farm received a $15,000 grant from the National Agriculture Trust Fund for the construction of a barn for storing vegetable crops. The farm was also named a USDA Farmer in Schools Project, the only agricultural project in the state of Florida to be so designated.\nIn 1967, a fire destroyed a barn full of animal feed. The Kline Farm was unable to recover from the lack of supplies and equipment to feed animals during the construction of a new barn and animal feeding facility. Due to inactive land development, the Kline Farm could not survive with the limited funding from the state. By 1969, the 7 farmers and staff of the Kline Farm found a new home at the South Florida State Farm, Northwest Agricultural School in Belle Glade, Florida operated by the Division of Extension of the University of Florida.\nBetty Brown Ewell had been a member of the Baptist Student Union while attending classes at Tampa Baptist University, then attended Union Bible College where she graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in music. Betty was the assistant director of the Kline Farm. The University of Florida hired Ewell to be the head of youth activities on the Belle Glade farms and to serve as a farm educator at the Belle Glade Farms.\nAs Assistant Director of the Kline Farm in 1969, Betty Brown Ewell was responsible, along with another farm administrator, for the day to day operations of 56 farmers. At that time, the Kline Farm was one of four operational farms in the South Florida State Farm. Betty Brown Ewell was also a teacher of piano in the Belle Glade School District.\nIn 1970, the Belle Glade Farms (the South Florida State Farm) was reorganized by the University of Florida and the Florida Department of Agriculture into the Belle Glade Farms Cooperative.\nThe Belle Glade area was an agricultural producer of citrus fruits for the entire nation. The Kline Farm, in its new location and position as a member of the Belle Glade Cooperative was well positioned to provide agricultural education and research on a larger scale. The new farm community location on the edge of a major citrus grove provided ready access to equipment and supplies.\nDuring the 1970\u2019s, Betty Brown Ewell served as a Belle Glade Farms Board member, a Florida Department of Agriculture Farm Advisory Committee member, and an extension specialist working under the direction of the University of Florida in extension education, teaching, and conducting agricultural research to the 500 acre farm community.\nBetty\u2019s leadership role also included the implementation of the Cooperative\u2019s \u201cFamily Agriculture Development Program,\u201d and the Cooperative\u2019s \u201cHeifer Project.\u201d After her service to the Belle Glade Cooperative, Betty Brown Ewell went on to accept a position with the University of Florida/County Cooperative Extension Service in Dade County.

{"text": "during the early stage of the avian influenza a(h7n9 ) infection in china in 2014-15. further experimental infection studies are needed to understand the roles of the other viral proteins and the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis.\nwe analyzed the effect of different concentrations of cholesterol on mtt [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. cholesterol was found to be a potent inhibitor of mtt reduction in all cell lines studied. in eca-109 and a549 cells, cholesterol inhibited mtt reduction mainly via induction of apoptosis. in huhmcv3a cells, however, cholesterol decreased mtt reduction by inhibiting cell proliferation. in rl9 (e-cadherin-transfected eca-109 cells), cholesterol inhibited mtt reduction through increasing the intracellular calcium [ca2+] and the expression levels of interleukin (il)-1\u03b2 [il-1\u03b2], interleukin (il)-8 [il-8], and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [tnf-\u03b1]. therefore, we suggest that the reduction of proliferation mediated by cholesterol in cancer cells with a high propensity for invasion is more important than the apoptotic effect of cholesterol in other cancer cells. these findings are likely to be relevant for developing cholesterol-lowering drugs for cancer treatment.\nmitochondrial targeting sequence-directed de novo antisense oligonucleotides (mtdnas) are an emerging class of drugs that have demonstrated in vivo efficacy in mouse disease models characterized by defects or perturbations of mitochondrial function. these studies suggest that dna-encoded mtdnas can mitigate deleterious effects of mitochondrial disease by restoring respiratory complexity or modulating gene expression. recently, mitochondrial dysfunction of nonspecific etiology has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular conditions, and atherosclerosis. targeting this mitochondrial dysfunction is a promising strategy for drug discovery to treat disease. we recently reported that mtdnas can reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by statin-induced impaired mitochondrial function. here, we expand upon these observations and use clinically relevant models of human statin-treated atherosclerosis (a mouse model with endothelial dysfunction) and type i diabetes mellitus (an insulin-resistant model with mitochondrial dysfunction) to explore the therapeutic potential of mtdnas for treating metabolism-disrupted conditions. treatment with mtdnas resulted in significant improvements in blood glucose and insulin levels. these improvements were associated with reductions in intracellular ca2+, and improvements in blood sugar and insulin were completely restored with the addition of antioxidants to mtdna treatment. additionally, this group of compounds protected from death insulin-secreting beta cells, which are vulnerable to oxidative stress compounded by high glucose. lastly, we found that mtdnas improved blood glucose, insulin, and lipid levels via the mitochondria-mediated inhibition of endothelial foam cell formation.\nthe recent clinical observation that the expression of the microRNA miR-103/107 decreases in metastatic colorectal cancer (mcco) has led to intense investigation of its function and regulation. miR-103/107 levels are generally under the control of epigenetic modification and transcriptional regulation, so we hypothesized that miR-103/107 may bind to its target sites near a cpG site in pre-mrna and that the demethylation of cpG in promoter regions of mrna regulatory genes may affect its expression. however, only 1 of 13 genes that contain a cg island in the 3-untranslated region (3-utr) was found to be a strong regulator of miR-10", "label": 1, "id": 100813}

{"text": "A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a rare movie that both the parents and the kids will like. In fact, I think this film would appeal to just about any age group. It's a feel good story with a great message. This was a very entertaining film that I just thoroughly enjoyed and didn't want it to end. I found it to be quite a good movie...I'm glad to have seen it.\nThe story is about two brothers, Paul (David Nibley) and Michael (A.J. Trauth). It is told in short segments about their life. It is a wonderful story of brotherly love and of two lives that were destined to intersect in an unexpected way. The lives of the two brothers as children parallel each other throughout their formative years. After a while you get to know them quite well and you're drawn into their story. From the moment they meet, these two brothers become inseparable, their lives as adults will intersect with surprising results. In fact, one of these brothers will make a promise to another brother, a promise he keeps for almost fifty years.\nOne day in their early childhood they watch as a young man is arrested on several accounts. The young man is placed under house arrest for a time and the two brothers befriend him. They learn that the young man is a musician and they like him for that reason, plus they are drawn to him for some reason they could not explain. The two brothers invite him to move in when the court order expires. One of the promises made was that they would move in with him for a time to help him get his feet back on the ground. They never saw him again after his house arrest was over until they were adults.\nThe main character in this story is Michael. He becomes a successful lawyer who makes his living in the corporate world. The other brother, Paul, becomes a musician and lives a bohemian life. Of course they don't see each other in all those years, so there is less interaction in the film between the brotherly pair. At some point, Paul and his wife are divorced and he winds up living with a girlfriend (Dylan Neal). Michael's marriage ends tragically and he is left with a little boy, Jake (Miles Chandler) whose mother just abandoned the lad, with no reason. Jake takes a liking to Paul and Paul to Jake.\nSeveral years pass and Paul's girlfriend makes an announcement...she is carrying a baby. At this point, Paul is now a successful musician and his girlfriend's brother works for his music company. They want Paul to name the baby, but he wants more information of his girlfriend's family. That's when he discovers that Michael is Jake's dad and is living in Los Angeles.\nNow the story becomes a love story between Paul and Michael's sister, Melissa (Eliza Dushku), a nurse practitioner who just started her own practice and a doctor she consults with on some of the cases (Scott Gibson). She's a doctor with a busy schedule. She and Paul also share a special bond...they are more like brother and sister than most siblings. She and Paul go on a wild goose chase to find Michael to tell him that he has a son. It becomes a family thing involving both Paul and Melissa's families, since Michael's sister has been trying to get in touch with her missing brother also and wants to see her nephew and niece. What a story!\nIt has some wonderful storytelling that makes it a film to remember. It has a lot of depth to the story (a little long), but it's worth the time spent on it, it's definitely worth seeing. The end of this film will make a lot of people cry...not at the sad part but the way the film is wrapped up. It has wonderful scenes involving the dog...I found those to be quite touching.\nThe acting of the two brothers, Paul and Michael, is exceptional. AJ Trauth does a wonderful job in the role. He gives a performance that is very endearing and believable. David Nibley does a very good job in this film. The actress that played the part of Melissa was a joy to see. I really loved the way she acted in this film. She has a nice personality, plus is a terrific actress. I loved the way she stood up to the doctor that just didn't listen to her and the way she handled things with her family. There are more characters in this film that have other roles. Each of the actors brings something special to their part(s).\nThis is a wonderful family movie", "label": 1, "id": 100815}
{"text": "Strings and RepresentationsHello. My name is Austin Bingham, and welcome to Algebra and Trigonometry, The Right Course. In today's chapter, we are going to talk about representations of lines by vectors. And we are going to do this in a geometrical way. So, I have this line here. And, I want to know how can I talk about this line mathematically. Well, one obvious way is, first of all, let's see, what's this line look like. It's just a straight line. So, it's just a straight thing. So, mathematically, I can use the same straight line symbol, \".\" That basically looks just like that, that just looks like a straight line, \".\" So, \"i\" is a point on this line, and \"j\" is a point on this line. So, I have \"i\" and \"j.\" And what I really want to do is talk about is what happens when I go from one to the other. So, if I think of going from one to the other by going over here, this distance over here is what I'm going to talk about. So, I have some of those numbers, then I'm going to add them together. And that distance is the thing that I have right here. And I'm going to talk about some of the things that are going to happen for that. So, we are going to start off by talking about some of the properties that we know for real numbers. And what I mean by that, is we know, for instance, that if I think of something as being less than something, I can say, \"oh, well, if it's less than, it's not equal to it.\" Which is, you can say, \"oh, well, if 5 is less than three.\" Well, then, by definition, that means that three is not equal to 5. And if it's less than it's also greater than it. If I say that this is less than this, well, I mean, I can say \"oh, well, well this is less than this because this is greater than it.\" So, we are going to want to say that if I'm dealing with distances I can say \"oh, well, if it's greater than this distance, then it's less than this distance.\" And if this distance is less than this distance, then we can say this one is greater than this one. And if this distance is greater than this distance, then this one is greater than this one. And what that's saying is, \"if distance a is greater than distance b, then distance a is also greater than distance b.\" It's talking about \"if and only if.\" So, I want to say, \"well, if I'm talking about the relationship between these things, this one's greater than this one, this one's greater than this one, but not both of them are equal to.\" Well, that's the if and only if rule. So, that's going to be some use of the order of addition, which is \"if you are using things together, you use 'then' and 'only if'\" you have to use 'then' right before 'then'. So, if I am doing a math problem with if and only if, I'm not saying I want to get to the thing I was getting to, I'm saying \"this is how you get there.\" So, that is telling you how the different parts go together. And you are using this thing \"then\" when you are going to have this part or these parts here and you have to use the other part here that's going to tell you how it got to get there, if you follow that sense of what this looks like. So, I've been talking about if a thing is less than another thing, you are talking about being greater than the other thing, you use the word \"then only if.\" And I want to mention too, in parentheses over here, that there's sort of, as you know, as you look at the work over your whole life, you see things that don't go as simply as we are telling you here. So, if I say, \"oh, well, suppose this, then I do that.\" I might do that, I might not do that. This is not a guarantee. It's just a tendency. And I have to be really careful about that, because it is not a guarantee. I might say \"okay, so if this line is less than this line, well okay, I'll do this. But if for some reason I can't do that, maybe I had a really bad slip of the tongue and what I really meant to do is do that. So, what happens if I get to this position \"", "label": 1, "id": 100816}

{"text": "The last glacial ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), up until ~20,000 BP.\nI am most certainly NOT a scientist or climate researcher.\nAll information is taken from what I have read, I.e. in newspapers, the Internet, and here on this web site.\nI have a natural curiosity as to how the world and its people evolve. Climate change is a fact of this natural history.\nPeople do not and cannot change it.\nThe fact that the earth has had warm cycles and iced cycles throughout its history.\nHowever, people try to blame their fellow man, even though the climate is driven by natural occurrences. For example, all the glaciers at the North and South Poles, along with all the mountains and valleys and all the animals and vegetation. These changes all have to do with the orbit and axis of the earth.\nWhat has been and will be are simple acts of nature.\nThese glacial periods are the natural fluctuations of our Mother Earth.\nThat's why people call them cyclical.\nThousands of years from now, there will be different cycles. Maybe even an ice age.\nClimate researchers claim that these are caused by greenhouse gasses. How can we blame something that is not caused by us?\nThere are so many false assumptions and statements from the people who study this topic that we, as the people who are the most affected by its consequences, have to start questioning the reliability of these claims.\nI'm only a humble journalist, in a way, because I am interested in finding things out and researching them. I ask questions.\nBut do I have all the answers? Of course not. I'm only trying to make sense of this whole 'climate change' issue.\nWhat I am trying to say is this: it's complicated.\nI'll give you a for instance: How come, in some areas of Denmark, you will step out of your house in a T-shirt in January and be warm, and in other parts of Denmark, it is so cold that you get frostbite in the same month?\nIs there any connection to the climate and its changes?\nWhy does climate research blame humanity for the changing climate?\nWhat are the facts and what's just the propaganda?\nI am a human being too, after all.\nIn 1884, climatologist and meteorologist William Ferrel created a model of atmospheric motion which was called 'Ferrel's Law'. It is a set of equations describing the behaviour of atmospheric masses (cloud, air, moisture, etc) around the world.\nAtmospheric physics is not my field, as I pointed out in the previous article.\nBut the idea of the 'global circulation' - which is the circulating pattern of gases, air and moisture on the planet - seemed to make sense.\nIt seems to correspond with what climatologists are saying now. Like, that the gases in the atmosphere can trap heat in the atmosphere so our polar ice caps will melt.\nI guess it is a model of how our gassy atmosphere works. It seems like common sense.\nOne thing this model does not include is humans, though.\nAnd that is what seems a little fishy to me. Because if a large part of our climate changes have to do with human activity, what is the point of not including people in the model?\nThere are a lot of people on this planet, and a lot of people emit gases into the atmosphere. So why not let them in?\nMaybe Ferrel could not include people back then. Maybe the amount of gassy emissions from human bodies was too small to be detected?\nAt the present moment, carbon dioxide emissions from mankind is thought to be at around 400,000,000 metric tons, or 400 million, per year.\nThis equals 1100 million tons per year, just of this certain gas. We are talking about a gas that, according to climatologists, has such a drastic effect on our greenhouse effect - that can be measured by its chemical formula, CO2 = 12O + 6C.\nIn 1820, the year the Industrial Revolution started, mankind was still at about 100 million tons CO2 per year, which was the level for the last 10,000 years, according to climatologists.\nSo people were emitting CO2 for thousands of years, but not long enough to have left any effects on the climate.\n", "label": 1, "id": 100818}
{"text": "Rural Affairs Secretary Fergus Ewing wrote to Colin Kennedy on the 26th August as he explained:\n\u201cI am replying to your email dated 30th July in which you raised concerns about the effect that the introduction of a new charging structure would have on local communities.\u201d\n\u201cYou were particularly anxious that the new parking permit concessions, which became available in July 2013, should be continued for as long as possible.\u201d\n\u201cMy officials have been in contact with a number of rural car parks concerned, and have consulted the wider public about the arrangements. I am grateful to you for raising this matter with me.\u201d\n\u201cI note that you are very keen to see the new parking system that took effect on 30th July 2012 rolled back to October 2011. Unfortunately rolling it back in time would involve a significant cost for the local authority and it is also, and importantly, difficult to change the arrangements as they are set out in legislation.\u201d\n\u201cI am advised that the Scottish Chartered Institute of Highways and Transportation has also provided their detailed cost analysis of the proposals to the Scottish Government and we have considered that analysis as part of the wider consultation exercise. A summary of that analysis will be provided.\u201d\n\u201cThat would indicate that the charge for a concessionary permit is no longer cost effective in terms of income generation and the associated enforcement costs.\u201d\n\u201cA cost benefit impact is calculated by weighing the income gained through on-street permit charges and the expenditure on associated enforcement costs.\u201d\n\u201cWithout the discount arrangements some car users would stop using the roads and parks which currently are not used by large volumes of motorists and many of which would quickly become congested.\u201d\n\u201cWithout some parking provision a number of important visitor destinations in your area would become more difficult or even dangerous to visit or would be under threat of being cut off completely because people would not be able to bring vehicles to such sites, for example, the local primary school and the nearby sports and recreational facilities.\u201d\n\u201cThe Scottish Government is therefore not going to be in a position to introduce a reduced concessionary charging scheme. It is expected that some of that income gained through the new permit scheme will enable certain services such as tourist information and the implementation of a safety scheme.\u201d\n\u201cThe other approach considered was to maintain the current system, but to seek a reduction in the fees charged to some classes of user. The current charging scheme will continue to operate.\u201d\n\u201cIn terms of options, my officials are advised that the Council could offer a reduced charge for short stay periods, possibly in the range of 20 minutes to one hour, on limited basis. There are limitations to what such a scheme would involve due to the associated costs to local authorities and the need to set appropriate standards for access.\u201d\n\u201cIn light of the above, it is therefore not possible to reverse the charging scheme now without a significant costly and disruptive change.\u201d\nIt had been suggested that some local car parks would become more unsafe, less accessible (including for the disabled community), and less attractive because of the proposed changes.\n\u201cIt is important to note that there may be occasions when there are specific situations where local communities might want to develop local measures to enhance their parking provision, in particular for the benefit of the local community. For example, an event such as a fun run or marathon might find that there is an excessive number of vehicles parked on local roads and therefore they wish to have a local scheme.\u201d\n\u201cI can advise the Council to contact me if they would like to discuss the matter in more detail.\u201d\n\u201cI therefore write once again to advise that the Scottish Government does not intend to introduce a scheme that would reverse the changes and that such a scheme would not be cost-effective in its current form.\u201d\n\u201cIt is however important to recognise that the future provision of a concessionary parking scheme will not be affected; however the current charging arrangements will continue.\u201d\n\u201cThe impact from the proposed changes, other than the changes to the concessionary permit arrangement, from July 2013 has been less severe than anticipated and has resulted in the Council having greater overall control over use of their car parks.\u201d\n\u201cIn terms of the future of the concessionary permit scheme, I am advised that the Council will be able to make this decision within their local context and the Council will need to make a judgement about how it wishes to deliver a sustainable service into the long term.\u201d\nLabels: Cllr.

{"text": "The third hurdle on the road to Wembley - after the draw and the qualifiers - was the play-off final. Liverpool wasted every opportunity in a scrappy second leg, but somehow won, and the chance to win a major trophy seemed real again.\nOn 21 May 1981 at Villa Park, Brendan lost, and it was a shock. The young players Liverpool had produced - and some they had acquired, like Ian Rush - never truly gelled, and no one took to the Premiership like they thought they would.\nLiverpool's fortunes did not improve - under Graziano - from 1981 to 1983, but they remained in top ten every year while the great and good were being dismantled for parts. Graziano's tenure lasted from October 1980 to October 1982, and with it came 12 games, 4 wins, 6 defeats and 2 draws, so, with an average league ranking of 10, Graziano's was a poor appointment.\nHe was replaced by Roy Evans. Like a lot of the new generation of managers, with little first team experience, most of the new appointments worked in the academies. Evans had been the head of the academy, so he knew as much as Graziano, and as much, but not more than Evans. He also had more experience of managing clubs than Graziano.\nIronically, Evans' first game in charge was the FA Cup Final. The defeat to Charlton (1, 2, 3) is still one of the most painful moments of Brendan's time at Liverpool - and one of the most memorable for Charlton. After the game, Roy said:\n\"I suppose we had no chance - this is the big time football. We had no idea what Liverpool really represents.\"\nEvans made some mistakes the second he took charge. His first was to put John Aldridge, who'd done well, behind the striker. The second was to field his weakest available starting 11 in an away semi-final against a reinvigorated Manchester United. Liverpool lost (0-1) but, despite the FA Cup defeat, he had saved Roy's job in the transfer window, and that gave him a chance to get it right.\nFor the 1983/84 season, Roy got it right. Evans signed Trevor Francis, Ray Kennedy, and Alan Hansen, bought Gary Gillespie from Manchester United, and signed new players - like Ian Rush - for what turned out to be his most successful season, including an FA Cup win after a 3-1 final win against Middlesbrough (2, 0, 1).\nBut, this was Brendan's era. He was now one of the senior players. He was one of the experienced Liverpool players - the older heads. And, in his third season, he was given the opportunity to take the captaincy that had already eluded him twice.\nLiverpool's league season started slowly under Evans, but Brendan would have been frustrated by his lack of opportunities. After being moved up to become a play-maker again, when it was obvious that he would never lead the line, in the second year under Evans, Brendan had already had a number of injuries, and with him - now a senior midfielder - the midfield looked a lot better.\nAs it turned out, the new season was one of the best in Liverpool's history. The young team gelled, and Liverpool won 18, drew 9 and lost 3 - not bad and they were only beaten by Arsenal (6-3) and Coventry (4-4) in the remaining 12 games, both in the league.\nThe league had changed with a massive 42 points required for a championship. Liverpool finished in a very creditable 2nd, only 3 points behind Arsenal.\nArsenal were also runners-up in the FA Cup. It was the first time since 1950 that two different teams had finished 2nd twice. They would later have a famous double (1970/71).\nThe Football League Cup was the third success of the era - and the first for Brendan. Liverpool beat Norwich City on penalties on 29 March 1984 and won 2-1.\nRoy made a great blunder with injuries in his last season.

{"text": "we report a fatal case of rickettsiosis in a woman living in a western state whose leisure activity was outdoor running on the Appalachian Trail in the southeastern U.S. during the summer and fall 2014. PCR for spotted fever group rickettsiae was positive, and the DNA sequence of the PCR product from the blood specimen of the patient, strain MG, matched sequence Sanger data from strain RP77 strain RG15034/AF287882, previously named Rickettsia bellii/Rb and Rb1B. The sequence results were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes. Infection was confirmed in the patient's husband by PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) with antiserum to rickettsial antigens detected in the blood specimen of the patient. The wife did not develop meningoencephalitic disease, but she developed fever, fatigue, and malaise for 5 months. She failed to respond to treatment with clarithromycin and atorvastatin plus doxycycline, and subsequently developed pneumonia and anemia. Despite aggressive diagnostic evaluation and therapy, she died from pneumonia and secondary infection, according to the death certificate. The case highlights the need to consider arthropod-borne infections in a previously nonendemic region of the U.S., and to report the unusual case to further understanding the epidemiology of rickettsioses.\nRickettsia bellii is a Gram-negative, spotted fever group rickettsia that infects mammals, especially rodents and squirrels 1. Humans typically become infected when bitten by infected ticks 2. The geographic distribution of this pathogen is unclear: it was recently described as infecting humans in 2 states in the Southern region of the United States, but its known host rosters include mice, voles, shrews, squirrels, and rabbits\u2014all species known to have been present throughout the entire Eastern seaboard of the United States 3. However, the host range for the human host is unknown. A human case of rickettsial infection in 2007 was reported, which had caused meningovascular disease 4.\nSpotted fever group rickettsiae are characterized by the presence of ompA and ompB genes, which encode proteins with carbohydrate-binding activity that have a role in pathogenesis 5. Strains were named based on the host that the strain was originally detected in. Strains isolated prior to 2002 were named R. bellii/Rb1 to R.cooleyi/Rc3; strains isolated from 2002 to 2010 were named R. bellii/Rb2 to R. bellii/Rb45; and strains isolated from 2011 were R. bellii/Rb1B. Since 2014, the term Rickettsia bellii/Rb is used to refer to those strains that are in the R. bellii/Rb1-45 and Rickettsia bellii/Rb1B phylogroups or are named and characterized as either R. bellii/Rb or R. bellii/Rb1 (the group to which MG belongs) 6. Although the rickettsiae have long been known to infect humans, the majority of human rickettsial illness in the United States occurs in Arizona and California 1,8. The geographic distribution of rickettsiae in the U.S. is not fully understood, but there have been reports of R. canadensis infection in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Washington 5,8.

In the United States and Western European countries, protein\u2010rich foods constitute <15% of the diet, whereas in developing countries such as China, protein constitutes 40% of daily calories. In China, dietary protein comes primarily from meat, and meat consumption is approximately 400\u2013500 g/d (>100 g/d above current guidelines). The consumption of high levels of protein is associated with an increased risk of CKD.\nThe most frequent complicating factors of CKD in the United States are diabetes and hypertension. Together, these comorbidities represent a high risk for progression to end\u2010stage renal disease in patients with CKD. The risk of death related to diabetes or hypertension is approximately 4\u2010fold greater in patients with CKD than in the general population.\nThe prognostic significance of proteinuria has been extensively studied. The magnitude and severity of proteinuria are important predictors of progression to end\u2010stage renal disease. The severity of proteinuria is also an important predictor of survival in patients with CKD. The relative importance of nonalbuminuric proteinuria is being studied. Nonalbuminuric proteinuria is a more accurate predictor of survival than albuminuria, and reduction in albuminuria decreases the risk of survival.\nRationale for Implementing a Renal Protection Strategy\nImmediate management of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a complicating factor for CKD, and can have a profound impact on the prognosis if left untreated. In some situations, the immediate goal of treatment should be to reduce the serum creatinine concentration.\nManagement of diabetes and hypertension. These disorders are major complicating factors of CKD. Together, they contribute to the progression of CKD, represent a significant risk of mortality, and significantly affect quality of life. Immediate goals of treatment include lowering serum creatinine and blood pressure, and reducing glucose and lipids as appropriate.\nMinimization of exposure to nephrotoxic agents. The risks of exposure to nephrotoxic drugs are well recognized in the health care community. In 2010 (revised in 2013), the International Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation released consensus guidelines about nephrotoxic therapies, and these guidelines are summarized in Table 5\u20103.\nTable 5\u20103: Key Elements of the 2010 (revised in 2013) Consensus Guidelines on Nephrotoxin Management\nReduce risk whenever possible when considering nephrotoxic medications.\nConsider avoidance in high\u2010risk situations, such as acute CKD, chronic CKD with electrolyte abnormalities, a history of recurrent AKI, and the elderly.\nConsider reduction for patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or with recurrent AKI when the drug is likely to prolong a critical stay in the hospital.\nConsider reduction for nephroprotective drugs such as dopamine, a1 A receptor blockers, and angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers.\nAssessment of albuminuria. Patients with proteinuria, especially nonalbuminuric proteinuria (>300 mg/24 h), are at increased risk for progression of CKD and future end\u2010stage renal disease (ESRD) and should be monitored and treated appropriately. The level of proteinuria may also be indicative of a high mortality risk in patients with CKD.\nAssess CKD stage and progression. CKD stages should be assigned based on eGFR according to either the MDRD or CKD Epidemiology Collaboration study equations. Progression should be monitored at least biennially. Acceleration markers, such as UAE or albuminuria, may also be of value.\nIdentify individuals at high risk for ESRD. ESRD prognosis depends on age and eGFR. The risk of mortality increases with age and progressively increases with a lower eGFR.\nIdentify individuals for renal transplant evaluation. The National Kid", "label": 1, "id": 100833}

It is time for all of this for it to stop focusing on short term results. This is not some selfless charity for \"poor old artists\". No charity. This is economic logic. It is about making the artists the center of the creative process. It is about recognizing where success will and won't come from, and about making the appropriate decisions in light of that. This can only happen if the music industry itself stops behaving as though it is a giant charity, or as though the artists (their customers) are a bunch of children not worthy of competent management. There is no magic. There are no shortcuts. The artists simply need some help. The record business wants to know; why is that the case?\nI don't know what that answer is. I know who I am. I don't know where you are. You probably know who you are a bit better than I do. Maybe we could learn from each other. There are probably tens of thousands of artists out there willing to make beautiful songs, to tour the country, to play their music for anyone who wants to come and listen, but no one can reach you. We can't play it in your stores and your bars. The marketplace refuses to exist outside the boundaries of giant conglomerates or the corporate culture of the record industry. We can't get people to see you or hear you or buy our records through the mainstream press. But it would be worth it for you. And it would be worth it for us.\nSo maybe we could start right there. There should be no corporate control over music and information, other than the limits created by copyright law. If someone wants to sell you a song he or she made, you should have the freedom to buy it (a la carte). The music industry has spent a lot of time and effort making sure that you don't have that choice-why does everyone still feel in charge? So I think the first step is to make it clear to the record companies: if they wish to sell you goods, they must sell it to you as \"artist-defined product\" (not label-defined). To be part of the marketplace, the artists must always decide what goes into it, and they must get paid for you to participate. We must be allowed to have a say in what we sell.\nWhat is the effect of this change? Well, artists would not have to worry about selling millions of records to make a living and get a good recording budget, and they would finally have the freedom to take risks on projects they really believe in. Artists would feel like they could do their best work.\nBeyond these obvious benefits, there are many lesser benefits as well. Artists would once again have a chance for sustained success. Labels would no longer have to choose between making small advances on risky ventures, or signing artists that don't actually have a chance to do anything. There would be hundreds of smaller (as well as bigger) markets available to artists. This change would allow local bands (the ones with all those CD-Rs in their pockets) to find some places to play, and thus a chance to grow an audience. Record stores would begin to sell things people wanted to buy, and would not have to rely just on the latest fad, for goodness sake. There would be a return to localized support for music.

{"text": "a new version of the phase method of determining the location of a source of emission in space, assuming the emission of spherically symmetric radiation or radiation of some other regular, symmetric form, having for each position only a single spherical wave of the same form. The phases (that is, relative angular differences in the directions of the electric radiation field vector) are computed, and the value assigned to each phase is derived from the amplitude of the radiation and from the value of a particular radial distance at the position of the detector from which the radiation is observed; the radiation field of the source is thus obtained by multiplication of its amplitude by absolute values of the phases, from which the source location is obtained by inversion of the phases.\nThe procedure was first used (1940) by the British physicist H. Tomlinson to describe the behavior of radation propagating in a medium without dispersion (homogeneous spherical layer) and by the British mathematician W. L.

{"text": "[17], [18]. In our recent work, we showed that one of the most basic principles guiding the evolution of DNA viruses is that a virus that can infect a cell, using its surface proteins, that does not have a surface protein it can use, will eventually become extinct [23]. We showed that if a virus infected a cell that did not have a surface protein it could bind to and infect, by not doing so for at least 500 times the timespan in evolution that a viral protein could bind for, that particular virus would become extinct [23]. For example, if a virus evolved to bind with a protein that could enter the cell that had the receptor for its virus and if another virus evolved and had receptors for some protein that could not enter the cell; i.e. the virus could only enter a cell that had a protein or receptor of the virus, then that virus evolving a protein it could not bind to would die out [23]. The evolution of a specific receptor and the virus proteins to use that receptor is an important mechanism during the spread of infections and viral diseases.\nSince one of our observations was that virus replication was important in the control of viral populations and the spread of infections [23], we investigated what effect changing the surface proteins (gene sequences) of viruses could have on the viral population. In our recent work, we modeled the evolution of some of these viruses and showed that the most likely result of evolution producing a change in some gene or gene sequence is that the viral pathogen would die out or spread but at an slower rate because the new mutant replicated more slowly than wild viruses [23]. But, we also showed that the virus population could evolve to produce viruses that could infect a new host cell of higher fitness. If that host cell had several proteins on its surface that could not be used to target its viral protein the new viral population would spread exponentially and outcompete old infectious disease populations [23]. We also found that the virus population that became extinct would spread as fast as their wild viral counterpart that kept the same gene sequences and that when evolving viral populations spread faster, wild population populations spread slower. The difference in spread can be measured in hours or days or even weeks with a spread rate of 2, 5, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 times that of its wild counterpart [23]. These results suggest that evolution in the populations of viruses can have a larger fitness (spread) impact than we previously thought, particularly with the evolution of the cell surface proteins that target viral gene products to the cell surface.\nThis study shows that mutations in gene sequences of a viral pathogen and the change in viral protein surface properties have profound effects on the virus itself as well as the evolution of that virus and its ability to infect other cells. Changes in protein surface properties and genetic mutations had profound effects on the rate of evolution of a virus by up to 10,000 fold. This effect increases when the viruses do not have receptors and receptors are added or changed over multiple generations. We then show how the evolution of receptors can change the shape of the curve of the spread of the virus and how the rates of spread of a virus population change based upon the evolution of its surface proteins.\nThe above findings show we have only just begun to understand the complex set of molecular interactions at the beginning of the emergence of an infectious disease and that the evolution of viruses is often more complex than previously thought. Understanding how mutations in surface genes and virus protein binding mechanisms effect virus evolution can be used to manipulate the emergence of infectious diseases by either reducing the spread of a virus or its pathogen as well as helping us to understand why infectious diseases can emerge and kill.\nBoth the authors of this article wish to declare that there is no competing interest that could be construed as influencing the results described in this paper.\n[1] Meng, H. and Wang, Y.L.

{"text": "aim. to determine the diabetic foot ulcer incidence and risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer in a 2 -year period. METHODS : This was a prospective study on the diabetic foot ulcer incidence among patients attending the endocrine clinic. Information was obtained with an objective diabetic foot care assessment on a standard protocol. Data on diabetic foot ulcers were collected and analyzed over a 24-month period, October 2011- October 2013. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled, 57 (50.01%) women and 56 (49.97%) men, of which 96 (82.98%) were aged <49 years. Mean duration of diabetes was 11 and mean age of onset was 24 years. The median duration of diabetes was 11 years. Previous foot ulcer was present in 30.3% of participants but were not associated with a higher rate of ulceration. The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer was 16.52 per 100 patients, perianal ulcers being the most frequent site of ulceration. The most common aetiology of diabetic foot ulcer was neuropathy (42.9%), with the most common ulcer type being a plantar ulcer in 133 (88.3%) of the 149 diabetic foot ulcers analysed. The most common causative factors were anatomical abnormality, peripheral neuropathy, plantar ulcer and peripheral vascular disease. Age <49 years old and duration of diabetes 22-40 years were associated with a higher risk of diabetic foot ulcer. CONCLUSION : Diabetic foot ulcers are associated with socioeconomic status and presence of diabetic nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease. However, previous foot ulcer was not associated with higher incidence of ulcers. AIDS CARE. 2015;27. Epub 2015/06/11. doi: 1017.1080/09540121.2015.1032947, 16 (4) pp. 589-594. ISSN 0954\u00960121.

Combs are placed in a square array.\nCarefully remove sand from the dorsal surface of the juvenile lobate from a mating pair with tweezers. Avoid damaging the thin filamentous antennae.\nCarefully examine the trunk and antennae of a laboratory lobate for injuries before moving it. Examine the trunk with a 20X hand lens for injuries or wounds to the surface of the cuticle, as well as small, de-colored spots on the body and any obvious wounds or injuries to the appendages. Examine the trunk for signs of encrustation with algal filaments or detached algal filaments, or any other unusual growth. Examine the antennae when the individual is an adult for obvious damage or injury at a magnification of at least 50X. Note abrasions, scrapes, lacerations, missing appendages (e.g., antennae or claws) or injuries. The antennae are thin and filamentous, with numerous tiny branches on their ends; these antennae might be damaged, and branches, or several ends, might be detached. Damage to or absence of the antennae does not usually reduce the reproductive capacity of this species. The male antennae are slightly darker and somewhat thicker than those of the female. Both antennae have five branches on the distal ends. The antennae of a young adult male are not much thinner than a juvenile. The branching ends of the antennae are usually darker and somewhat thicker than the proximal, unbranched sections of the antennae. Note the presence of an operculum to cover the opening of the rectal atrium. The adult male will be more slender than the female, with longer (60\u2013134 per side) and more fragile claws located farther back on the trunk (Figs. 168, 169). Adult females may have slightly larger claws, but this information is difficult to obtain. Cut the muscles back from the trunk to identify the rectal atrium and note its size. A single pair of male appendages (claspers), one on each side, is also located a little behind the operculum. The appendages are fragile, covered with small branching hairs and a dark band of dark green to black cells on the bases. Both the posterior claws and the appendages at the anterior end of the trunk may be missing in adults from heavily fished ponds. The claws are located behind the operculum, with the trunk between the claws and the operculum, and the claws are located beneath the operculum. The anterior claws of males are smaller and longer than the posterior claws. The anterior claws are located between the anterior ends of the antennae and are usually found detached from the trunk or broken off from the trunk. The posterior claws usually extend from the cuticle slightly past the anterior claws.\nLobate trout, like some other species, have a tendency to move about slowly during the day. At night, they will often dive into the bottom. Lobate trout frequently leave their hiding places to feed in the twilight. During the day, lobate trout usually prefer to remain close to sheltered areas because the ambient temperatures reach highs of 24\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C. They rest with their trunks slightly elevated off the bottom and their antennae just protruding. They are easily frightened, and will often rapidly dive deeper and hide in a crevice if disturbed. Lobate trout feed in openings of the substrate on a wide variety of invertebrates, including crustaceans, including isopods (e.g., Ischyrocera nebulosus). Lobate trout reach maturity within the first year and do not spawn prolifically, however, they can spawn in any month. This species is a popular game fish. Lobate trout are sometimes intentionally introduced into lakes and ponds.\nKuehne, John R. 1999a. Lobate Trout, Galaxias rostratus Godeaux. Page 265, Figure 6 in: The Fishes of Wisconsin.

A conference call on this topic will be announced, and the team will provide a brief update on that portion of the program.\nIn October a team will attempt to recover the targeting image and confirm the identity of PS1-14ctb, a rare, nearby Type Ia supernova visible in a ground-based image acquired last fall, by re-imaging it with HST.\nPS1-10afx is a candidate, and PS1-10dgs may have turned into a very bright flare. This flare, if it is there, may have also resulted in the discovery of a new supernova. The team may present information about this flare next week.\nIn April 2007 the supernova program celebrated its tenth anniversary by holding a program review meeting. For those who might be interested, a short summary from that meeting might be appropriate here. Overall, the team has discovered 350 supernovae with the HST. The Hubble space telescope was not designed to study supernova, nor was it ever intended to make a program of it. Its discoveries far exceeded the expectations of the team, and it has continued for more than a decade because it remains an important goal.\nThe program can only take advantage of its opportunity to observe supernovae by working very quickly. This was very challenging with the program's limited time on HST. The team had to be very selective about which targets were pursued first when making the scheduling decisions. This meant that many supernova did not get observed with HST until several years after their initial discovery, and many more were never observed at all.\nThe program was also very successful at obtaining follow up observations with large ground based telescopes. Over 150 supernovae have received this additional observation. Of the supernovae observed with HST, the team discovered 37 spectra (images with supernovae seen in them), with two additional supernova found in follow up with HST, 30 more were subsequently identified in follow up observations. The most difficult task is the recovery of the SN, and only 26 have subsequently been found in ground based images. The reason supernovae, with their rapid decline, are so difficult to find in ground based images is the supernova are not always at their peak brightness when the image is made, and often some of the background emission (from the host galaxy, diffuse light from nearby galaxies, or other sources) obscures the brightness of the supernova. For the supernovae not recovered in ground based images the spectra did not show clearly enough signifacant difference in the spectral features to identify the supernovae, which might not be the same as what one would expect from type Ia SNe.\nOne of the most important advantages of the program was the very detailed multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of the SN host galaxies.\nMany of the hosts in this catalog remain in galaxy groups with large amounts of dust. This prevents a detailed morphological study of the host galaxies by ground based telescopes.\nA survey of all known supernovae with the HST was undertaken by the IAU Supernova Coordinating Committee. This resulted in a list of 377 supernovae with the HST. Some of them were from other programs, but 21", "label": 1, "id": 100848}

Their major physiological role is still unknown. We demonstrate that cyclotides are eukaryotic mini-proteins with a new family of cysteine knots. In addition to the conserved cyclotide fold signature, cyclotides exhibit a new 3D structure with three disulfide bonds (two in C-helices and one in an A-helix). These new structural and functional features of cyclotides allow their use as a new strategy for generating plant- and cell-based biomaterials. Protective cell coat, an extracellular and membranous layer around cells that acts as a barrier to pathogens and toxins.\ncyclotides (small protein, peptide, cytokine, etc.) bind to a substrate, but do not seem to have an enzymatic activity, and are thus not antibodies. However, they do affect cell death by toxicity.  These proteins kill the target cell by toxicity as they can form complexes with aminophospholipids in the target membrane and cause the formation of pores that lead to membrane damage and cell death.\nCyclotides are not antibodies, nor do they have any obvious cell-killing activity, however they have the potential to do both of these functions.\nClinical research (1): The research by the National Academy of Engineering has allowed cyclotides to be discovered as very potent medicines that can help cure various diseases. It has brought them to the forefronts of biomedicine, and has allowed them to be applied to medicine.\nClinical research (2): More research can be performed on these proteins to allow them to be further investigated with potential drug and medicinal uses.\nFishing.

An extraction technique that allows for the extraction of various marine and freshwater materials. The protein-rich biomaterials can be used in cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical applications.\nDiseases. Cyclotides that bind to specific targets can be used against disease because once they bind to something, they essentially have a higher affinity to bind to that target. This is how they are toxic though.\nVaccines. Once they create specific vaccines that bind to known toxins and contaminants, it would allow for the detection of these things, and also could help create medicine against them. This would also create a much more effective method of detoxification.\n\"A mini protein is a peptide-based material with a fold and structure unique to its species. These proteins are typically present at less than 5ppm (parts per million by dry weight) in their organism. 23% of proteins were found to be mini proteins, however a mere 0.3% were found to be uniquely identifiable, and 0.001% were found to exhibit novel folds. There are four main classes of proteins: cytokins, coagulins, cell-wall anchoring proteins, and proteases. One unique example discovered during the research was the discovery of a Mt. Fuji protein that is an anticodon. Amino acids on the ribosome have an anticodon, which helps aid in the tRNA decoding process by giving a unique anticodon which bonds to it.\"\n\" A peptide is a small protein used in drug research. Peptides are an easily synthesized protein with many applications for medical research. Due to their small size, they are able to fit into binding pockets on protein receptors on the cell surface. These receptors are targets for many proteins involved in processes ranging from metabolism to inflammation. Proteins may be a cure for many diseases, but in drug research, peptides are a crucial step in getting there. Peptides have many advantages over traditional forms of proteins since they are easier to synthesize, are stable for many years, and are very small.\"\nThis page was last modified on 9 March 2014, at", "label": 1, "id": 100849}

{"text": "Of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to a greater degree the spirit of the age than the Easy Rider. The film, which came out in July 1969, had two major ingredients: a great central love story and a counterculture soundtrack.\nThe love story was a tender one between the film's narrator, an affluent aspiring journalist, and a young hippie. The music, the score that is (as the credits state), was an evocative mix of rock, folk and blues. It included work from The Band, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Moby Grape, The Beach Boys, Janis Joplin and Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was, to be sure, a perfect piece of zeitgeist marketing.\nThis week, some 40 years later, one of the lead actors, Jack Nicholson, was back in Hollywood to promote a movie in which he plays someone very different from the character that has come to define him.\nDouglas Smith, one of the film's producers, saw Nicholson recently at his studio on Pacific Avenue. \"He came over to visit,\" Smith said. \"It's just him and me. He brought it. He came over and just started going at it. It was just all that passion you associate with Nicholson, the same enthusiasm that he had when he was in his thirties.\"\nThe film, is, on the surface, very, very different from the movie that brought Nicholson a nomination for Best Actor, which he won. And yet, at the same time, you can't understate just how similar both movies are. While they are very much products of their time, at their essence, they are, really, very much the same story.\nTo that point, the characters that the Hollywood powerhouse depicts tend toward extreme behaviour. In 'Wolfman,' Jack Nicholson is a lonely, elderly man, living by himself on the Oregon coast. At a diner that is the heart of the community, people who sit there know him. They know to expect the usual. He shows up for dinner every day, and gets his eggs, hash browns. He's a quiet man.\n\"The rest of his life he lives like it's 1919,\" Smith said. \"In the 21st century, he is living life much as it was in the early 1900s.\"\nOne night he catches sight of a woman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, in a diner. She gives him the once over, then looks away. When he goes over to speak to her, he gets a few inches from her and she tells him to back up.\n\"Back up and get out of my face,\" she says. \"I never have to see you again.\"\nHe does, and later that night, he returns. He sneaks into his grandson's house, and breaks in. He breaks the bedroom window so he can sneak into the room. Eventually, like a kid, his nerve gets the better of him and he wakes up the grandson, who grabs his bat and chases his grandpa away.\nBut Jack, like any man in his late stage of life, wants to take what he wants, and he's a man bent on revenge. The next day, he comes to the diner and, again, starts staring at Mary Elizabeth. She, again, gives him the once over. When he goes over to talk to her, she throws him out of the cafe. He goes and does some damage, which is just inexplicable, he is on the other end of that behaviour. Later that day, he comes to the diner again. He orders the fries, but this time, he just walks up to her, and kisses her on the mouth.\nAt that moment, it was the only thing he had to offer.\n\"He came to find something to give, this man who was searching for meaning, to find meaning,\" Smith said.\nThis is not unlike Dennis Hopper, in 'Easy Rider,' looking for meaning. Hopper's character travels from Los Angeles to New Orleans on an endlessly churning machine, a motorcycle with one last tank of gas and enough booze to see that tank to its very bitter end.

It takes a talent, a unique flair, something that'll draw people in, make them come back.\nThat's just how it was with the infamous Mr. Ernie, who came up with an idea for a fast-food sandwich 50 years too late.\nFoss El came out with the Elmwood Grinder (the El-Mister) in 1959. It was an unremarkable sandwich consisting of mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes and two or three slices of baloney or bologna (the word \"sandwich\" comes from sandwiches, after all).\nBetter than 50/50\nBut Elmwood Grinders also offered a special drink. You'd get a cup of juice, milk or coffee. Or you could buy an extra ounce for one-fourth the price of a cup of juice or milk.\nWas it better than half? That's what Foss El marketed.\n\"It's better than a 50/50, it's 75/25.\"\nAt $0.20, an extra ouncer of juice cost only 4.06%. But in order to make the 4.06% of one ouncer pay off, you'd have to drink enough of the Juice Ouncer that -- after the first cup of juice or milk -- not only would more juice or milk have to be added, but you'd have to buy a second cup as well.\nAnd, not being a drinker, most El-Mister customers would know that.\nIt didn't help that Foss El's competitors were already serving \"juice boxes\" (and also offering extra ouncers for 4.06%).\nAnother problem Foss El had was that even in the late 1950s, \"juice,\" with a \"U,\" was associated with children, whereas \"juice,\" with an \"I,\" was a euphemism for the opposite of juice.\nOne of the problems that Foss El had was that as you drank a second ouncer, the extra-sweet, extra-sour flavor got lost to drinkers who had been acclimated to the plain old stuff.\nAnd yet another problem was that milk was a lot more liquid than juice, so El-Mister customers had to drink more juice in order to get their quota for the day.\nOn top of that, Foss El sold his milk in glass bottles. You'd get your ouncer of juice in plastic cups, then you'd head over to the milk fridge and pick out a fresh, clean bottled milk. It was easy to see that you'd be drinking a more expensive juice versus milk deal.\nStill, I'll bet a fair number of folks did buy the drink.\nIt had to be a bummer for Mr. Ernie to watch his business tank, but at least he found out that it is indeed possible to get better than 50/50.\nPosturing and positioning: The art of looking like everyone and no one\nHere's one of those posts that takes a position, then tries to back away from it so they can say they took everyone into consideration and were very neutral:\nBank of England Governor Mervyn King, left, is seen after speaking at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) annual conference in Bournemouth, southern England, Tuesday.

The proposed pathway includes several steps that are unexplored in the literature. One of these steps is the dehydration activation of C3,5-unsaturated keto esters, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and its esters, on HPO-Pi catalysts. The rate constant for this reaction, which is shown to be rate-limiting for all the reactions in this pathway and thus for the whole catalytic cycle, is highly sensitive to pH (100 to 500 times as sensitive as at the standard conditions); this indicates that the mechanism of the process is a pH effect, and also suggests that proton transfer along the entire reaction pathway is slow. The kinetics of activation of penta-1,5-dienol by hydrogen bond activation on HPO-Pi was also investigated. The keto-enol intramolecular isomerization is much faster (7 orders of magnitude) than that of its corresponding dinitrile, and the mechanism is ascribed to enzyme-like activation of its hydroxyl group through proton transfer.

{"text": "About 900 people packed into Toronto's Opera House on Tuesday to watch the Toronto Argonauts, who've never won the Grey Cup in their 12-year existence, play for the title they've twice failed to capture in the four years since they last won it. The crowd came in waves at the front door of the venerable theatre, which is about the opposite of BMO Field when it comes to ease of getting in to see the home games.\nEven before kick-off, a 15-minute pre-game video set the stage for the night's main attraction. This was followed by speeches that were largely free from the cynicism that has infiltrated professional sports in recent years and the game itself, which featured three lead changes and a late surge by Saskatchewan in a tight defensive struggle. But that all came after a stirring performance by singer-songwriter Feist of \"The Park, the River\" and her first big hit \"Mushaboom.\"\nAnother favourite, K'Nann and \"Pow Pow\" kept the crowd pumped from the seats on the lower bowl, and one of the more memorable highlights of the night was a performance by the Jordin Arnold Jazz Quartet, a group of five talented young musicians on the University of Toronto jazz programs. They performed \"This Is What We Came For\" and \"Chasing the Wind\" and drew rave reviews from the sold out crowd.\nThen the game came. With less than two minutes left and the Riders on defence, Saskatchewan's 15th-ranked Adam Petrangelo was called for interference on a punt return that ultimately became the game-winning point for the Argos. It was the first interference call of the night and was a game-changer, much like Petrangelo's three interference penalties on previous possessions.\nArgos quarterback Ricky Ray was stellar, going 22-for-36 with 303 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air. Saskatchewan back-up Darian Durant completed 21-of-39 for 371 yards and three touchdowns as the Riders defence was stifling, holding the Argos to 188 yards of offence.\nThe Grey Cup had been in Toronto twice in the past, with the Argos and the BCCA respectively, the first time in 1922 and the second time in 1945. A 2007 CFL decision added the city to the Grey Cup rotation. So this year, the 2013 Grey Cup was in Toronto.\nAnd while people were disappointed on many levels that the game didn't live up to the hype, the performance by the players, management and volunteers should be nothing but praised. The Argos were in the driver's seat in the final seven minutes of play but blew a big lead in the dying seconds. And while no one would blame the fans for giving way to sadness after the game, by the time the players had left the floor, they had the stage to themselves and the fans were singing along to \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" and \"Toronto Bad Boy.\"\nAfter the game, the Argos' celebration continued at Queen's Park, where a giant 2013 Grey Cup Championship parade would take the team back to their locker room. This all followed the Argos 2012 victory parade a year ago. But this time, they were making a second straight appearance in the final.\nThe next Grey Cup championship game will be in Toronto on November 24, 2013.", "label": 1, "id": 100861}

The purpose of network capacity planning is to predict future demand on a telecommunications network to meet growth demands in the future and to allocate needed financial resources in the present. The present study introduces a Network Capacity Planning (NCP) model to predict growth in cellular network demand (e.g. radio cell, wireless service, subscriber, or line) using a methodology that integrates geo-demographic modeling, mobile phone projections, and telecommunications network planning. The NCP model uses spatial (point level) and agent-based (line level) components to account for spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile phone market and telecommunications networks. The NCP model is applied for cellular demand forecasting in Los Angeles for the period of 1990\u20132006. The model predicts number of lines per cell by year and per cellular market area (CMA) by year. The prediction accuracy of the network capacity model is confirmed with independent forecasts by a mobile phone market share forecast. By applying the NCP model, a cellular network is considered \u201ctoo small\u201d if there is no room for cellular growth in the time span of the study (2004\u22122006). In the study area, the network capacity model indicates the need for 157 cellular radio sites to meet subscriber demands for the period of 2004\u22122006. This indicates that the network growth rate in the study area is substantial and that by current trends, it is likely that the cellular network will expand to fill the total geographical area of the region. The spatial heterogeneity of the cellular market is indicated by market share maps and point maps of cellular market shares. For example, CMAs (such as CMA 402) with a small base of telephone lines in 1998 or 2002 (i.e. fewer than 100 lines) showed large growth rates in demand (i.e. in subscriber numbers) in 2004 and 2005. On the other hand, CMAs (such as CMA 400 and 401) with large base telephone lines in 1998 or 2002 had negative growth rates (i.e. decreasing subscriber numbers) in 2004 and 2005. The implications are discussed for telecommunications network design and capacity planning for L.A.

Secondary aim: to evaluate if proliferation or apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) is correlated with peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). METHOD: a clinical retrospective study with 80 eyes-40 patients with DME and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Peripapillary RNFL thickness (peripapillary RNFL-thinning) was measured by GDxV. Tissue sections were stain via Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) to evaluate RPE proliferation (RPE proliferation), and via Trypan Blue (TB) to evaluate RPE apoptosis (RPE apoptosis). RESULTS: Patients with DME were 7.08 \u00b1 2.32 years older than the control group (p=0.0014). Macular thickness was significantly higher (198 \u00b1 55.8 \u00b5m) in the group of patients with DME in comparison with control group (164.9 \u00b1 53.2 \u00b5m) [p= 0.0087].

{"text": "Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of education and reason created new spaces to think and discuss philosophy and political issues concerning social reform. The American Revolution, French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars created a new sense of nationalism and identity among European and American intellectuals as these thinkers began to question existing social, governmental and economic systems from the ground up. Throughout this tumultuous century, thinkers including Rousseau, Kant, Voltaire and Jefferson used the idea of the autonomous individual as a starting point for critique of traditional societal institutions and for outlining solutions to some of the worst humanitarian disasters of the time.\nThe works of Enlightenment thinkers often contain the idea that individuals are capable of developing the critical ability to reason and formulate independent ideas. They also assert that those ideas are capable of changing, developing and evolving in a way that can create reform within society in positive and powerful ways. In an age when most men and women felt powerless, these thinkers suggested new ideas about what power did not have to be tied to a monarch or a military force. Instead, they suggested the possibility of power coming from knowledge of oneself and those around him.\nOne of the ideas of the Enlightenment that would have a radical effect on society was the concept of \"freedom of speech.\" This idea came to fruition through the new philosophies of freedom and humanitarianism that were being introduced throughout Western Europe and the United States in the 18th century. In \"The Rights of Man\" Thomas Paine, a journalist, argued that all people are entitled to the same freedoms from government, regardless of social status or ethnicity. People were now believed to have more of an active role in the government of the society in which they lived.\nThroughout the 18th century, Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the need to challenge the political, religious and social beliefs and institutions of the time. One man who took this ideal and ran with it was Voltaire. Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer, historian, philosopher and social commentator. His most famous work, \"Candide,\" is a satirical work in which a young man is raised to believe the earth is the best of all possible worlds, and once he sees how badly things can be, he concludes the best thing an individual can do is to live contentedly in a state of \"philosophical optimism.\"\nJefferson and Rousseau are two of the best-known Enlightenment thinkers of the age. Both men were born in the middle of the 18th century, and they had profound impacts on the events of the time. Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of the United States, and his most well-known work is the Declaration of Independence, which outlined the principles of government for the new nation. Rousseau, who was considered a champion of the common man, is known for helping to found the idea of the public good rather than the private or public. Jefferson and Rousseau were both social critics of the time and were important leaders in Enlightenment thought.", "label": 1, "id": 100866}

In fact, no musical at all! This picture was probably the film debut of one of Hollywood\u2019s most legendary actresses, Veronica Lake, whose long, flowing curly \u201cpeek-a-boo\u201d hair was used to full advantage during the film\u2019s early sequences, giving her the nickname \u201cThe Vamp from Lake Pepin\u201d.\nLake had made her debut only two years earlier in Sullivan\u2019s Travels (1941) and did manage to garner minor roles in an additional 38 films until her unfortunate death at age 50 in 1973. The only song on this album features Lake\u2019s only film duet with her co-star, John Carroll, singing the romantic \u201cOn The Wings Of Magic\u201d.\nThe cast features a host of Hollywood veterans, including George O\u2019Hara, who is credited with coining the phrase \u201ctalking pictures\u201d upon seeing the first screening of The Jazz Singer (1927). In this film, O\u2019Hara plays the villain of this story, but most famous for his portrayal of the title role in the original silent version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923).\nThe hero of the piece is John Carroll, the \u201cKing of the Broadway Musical, and a former partner of Noel Coward in producing Broadway productions such as The Dancing Years, The Chocolate Soldier, and Rosalie. Carroll is probably the only one here with the voice to bring this early stage show to life.\nThis film was based on a theatrical production of a play by Dorothy Baker (author of the novel The Little Foxes) originally known as \u201cMoon-Light and Melody\u201d. It is believed that the show debuted sometime around 1935 with Ruth Chatterton in the leading role of a movie star on the eve of divorce from her millionaire husband, played by John Carroll, who must decide between a comeback movie role and a chance at recapturing his starry wife\u2019s heart.\nThe story begins the opening night party celebrating the marriage of Carroll\u2019s character to his new bride, played by Veronica Lake. The picture quickly shifts to backstage, where a film director played by George O\u2019Hara has just informed the actress playing Lake\u2019s character that he is cancelling the film and going to marry his leading lady on-stage. The scene ends with a duet between Carroll and Lake, singing \u201cOn The Wings of Magic\u201d on a rooftop.\nThe song was written for this film by Oscar-winning composer Ralph Rainger (\u201cThanks For the Memory\u201d, \u201cBrazil\u201d, \u201cThanks to You\u201d), and, although never nominated for an Academy Award, it certainly would have been a deserving choice along with the other numbers from this film in terms of the sheer number of singable verses.\nThe song\u2019s opening verse provides a look at the story\u2019s beginnings inside Carroll\u2019s character\u2019s home:\n\u201cI was walking down the driveway of dreams/When the moon in the window smiled at me/And somewhere from a distant far,/Sparkled the eyes of the girl I love/On the wings of magic/On the wings of magic/She is my destiny/A fairy with charms,/On the wings of magic/On the wings of magic\u201d.\nBy next verse, however, Lake\u2019s character (and all their romance-related troubles) have entered the picture in a more-in-dept look at how their love lives are at once ruining and inspiring the film-within-the-film that they are currently filming:\n\u201cShe is a little girl with golden curls,/Her laugh a sweet little song,/And it echoes to the stars/When she holds the loves of my life in her arms,/On the wings of magic,/On the wings of magic\u201d.\nThe film\u2019s story then switches back to the night of the opening ball, and the duet between the two as they watch Carroll\u2019s character get out of a cab and make his entrance into the party. They end the first half-chorus with a look at the challenges they each might face as they begin their new lives together (I think).\n\u201cShe has a little home with bows of daisies/On the wings of magic/The kindness in her smile/Sets me in the spell of the whole world/Through the years", "label": 1, "id": 100867}

This is also time for your group to ask questions and take the leadership through prayer time.\nAfter saying goodnight for the evening, your leader will take the rope to gather the group together for some more time of singing and fun. The leader will then take everyone on their way to their bunks. Leaders are encouraged to make rules about lights out so everyone can get to sleep.\nFriday and Saturday morning starts the same with a continental breakfast (bagel, cream cheese, jam, jelly, cereal, juice, coffee, and tea). This is a time to start getting ready to be on the road by 9:30am and off to a day of fun. Some leaders take the entire weekend from Friday morning until Monday afternoon.\nThere are two dining tents at the campsites, as well as a bath house. The dining tent has benches in it so you can spread out a bit to eat. In the bath house there are sinks for your hair, and a shower to wash off the day's fun.\nOn our own property, we have a pool, play room, fishing pond, basketball court, volleyball court, shuffle board, tetherball, swim raft, and more.", "label": 1, "id": 100874}
{"text": "Between Bingen and Bonn, the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine\u2019s central district like a ribbon through the air. The Middle Rhine, like the Upper and Lower Rhine, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area between Linz am Rhein and Bingen am Rhein was declared a heritage site in 2002. In these 65km, the Middle Rhine boasts a total of 40 castles.\nThe Middle Rhine valley is a hugely popular touristic destination. The river is part of the legendary \u201cRomantic Road\u201d, which connects the North Sea with the Mediterranean. A few kilometers downstream from Bingen am Rhein, the river crosses the border from Germany to the Netherlands.\nThe steep and spectacularly shaped cliffs on both sides of the river as far as Linz am Rhein are also a popular destination for bikers, climbers and walkers.\nThe Middle Rhine is part of a landscape, which is characterized by very special features :\n\u2022\ta natural riverbed, formed by glacial movement more than 10.000 years ago\n\u2022\tvery steep, almost unnavigable riverbeds, often cut across in the upper and lower areas on either side of R\u00fcdesheim\n\u2022\tshaped valleys, often divided up with high stone walls, forming narrow chasms and deep gorges\n\u2022\ta strong presence of man-made constructions: castles, vaults, basements, buildings and stone walls on either side\nThe Middle Rhine landscape is as stunning from the water as from the vantage point of one of the many castles built upon its rugged banks.\nTo give you a better idea of the topography, have a look at the following aerial photos of each of the ten castles located along the shores of the Middle Rhine:\nTourist infrastructure along the Middle Rhine is well established and of high standard. All towns and cities along the river have very good cycling paths, making cycling a pleasurable activity along the Riverbanks.\nCastles are open all year round. Most villages and cities have their own small market in the summer months. The most famous town is undoubtedly R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein, home to Siegfriedstra\u00dfe, the Drosselgasse, and the Marksburg Castle.\nDue to steep slopes, the river has more than 20 locks to allow safe passage for the vessels. Along the length of the Middle Rhine from Linz to Bingen, you find twelve locks in the upper section and another ten in the lower section.\nFrom Linz am Rhein to Bingen am Rhein, the river can be accessed at: Hahnweiler, Neuburg (R\u00fcdesheimer) Lock, Hohenbueren (St. Goar), St. Goarshausen (St. Goar, Niederwasser) Lock, Kaub, Neubronn, Trechtingshausen, Bacharach, Assmannshausen, R\u00fcdesheim (Siegfriedstra\u00dfe) and Bingen am Rhein.\nTo access the castles directly for a closer look (and for the experience of climbing up on top of them, if you dare!) - and to enjoy a more stunning view of the River, you need to pass through one or more of the locks, the upper section of which is from Linz to St. Goarshausen and the lower section from St. Goarshausen to Bingen. There are more than twenty locks on the Middle Rhine.\nThe Middle Rhine is one of the busiest commercial river routes in the world. Vessels on both the German and the Dutch side of the river handle the majority of imports and exports between countries.\nThe Rhine is the most important waterway in Germany and is connected to the Danube at Kelheim. In Bonn, the Rhine separates the North from the South Rhine, and, from there, it flows into the Netherlands and on to the Schelde Estuary and from there to the Atlantic Ocean by sea.\nIn total, the 1300km long Rhine flows through the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg before finally reaching the delta in Belgium. However, the Rhine River (like many of the other rivers in the area) is actually formed not at its mouth, but at Mainz, where it is formed by the confluence of the Main, the Neckar and the Danube.\nIt flows through the Rhine's central district like a ribbon through the air.

{"text": "At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims who were also under the control of the Sufi orders. It is possible that the Mongols' Sufi followers introduced to the Mongols the idea of building their own independent state, with Genghis Khan as its head and leader.\nIt is also possible that, as the Mongols expanded their territories, they found Muslims who were practicing a separate religion and a separate civilization which the Mongols could accept without giving up their own identity. Mongols have always had a great respect for the power of the Turkic tribes and the Persian-speaking peoples, and in the 12th century many had already heard wonderful tales of their great civilizations. By this time the Mongols' own tribal religion had already undergone Christianization; in their new empire the Mongols found many Christian as well as Muslim believers in the religion they admired most.\nBecause the Mongols' way of life had become more \"civilized\" during the preceding centuries, they could be more amenable to adopting religious practices that the nomadic Mongols of the 13th century did not know: for example, the Mongols could become followers of Islam. However, because the Sufi orders that were becoming increasingly powerful among the Mongols were able gradually to modify many Mongol religious ideas so as to make then compatible with the basic doctrines of Islam, they were not forced to become Muslims in order to be active practitioners of the faith.\nThe Mongols themselves believed that the Mongol state was the source of their worldly strength and therefore regarded it as the source of their religious power, not the Sufi orders. Consequently, when any Mongol who wanted to live as a Muslim became one, the Mongol state allowed him or her to do so and offered the new convert financial and military support until the Muslim reached that point in religious practice known as \"having reached certainty\" about Islam's being correct.\nBecause of their admiration for Islamic civilization and because, under the influence of Islamic religion and the Mongol Khanates of Central Asia were able to provide economic and cultural support for the Turkic and other Muslims, the Muslim Mongols gained more influence within the population of the Mongol Khaganates than they had in the earlier centuries. This, as well as the fact that their rulers became great patrons of architecture, painting, the arts, and crafts, eventually made the Mongols' descendants forget Mongolian traditions and even Mongolian language. Their descendants adopted from the Muslims their written characters and their culture. As a result of their Muslim practices, the Mongols became more like the Muslims and gradually began to forget their own language and culture. Consequently, the Mongols of the 13th through 15th centuries, including many of the descendants of Genghis Khan, converted to Islam, and most of the Mongols' descendants today are Muslims.\nThe Muslim Mongol dynasties that ruled in Persia were called Timurides. A famous Mongol emperor of the Muslim Timurid period was Abdalqadir ibn Nasir-Allah, who ruled in the 15th century and left his name to the capital of the state he built, Damghan, as well as to his descendant, whom the Mongols considered as a saint and as the son of Allah, and whose most holy name was called \"Abdalqadir.\"", "label": 1, "id": 100879}
{"text": "Based on an actual story, John Boorman shows the struggle of the working class as they are thrown at any of the injustices you can imagine and shows how they pull together to help each other to get through it all. While the film shows the brutality and the suffering of the day to day working class struggle for survival against a hostile ruling class, it also shows the strength of the spirit when you pull together with your friends. This is a film made in an era of British cinema where the government was looking to move away from realistic portrayals of working class life and this would have the studio put the kybosh on this film and not allow it to be released. Luckily Boorman had the faith in the project to not back down and release it. As a result it is one of those great films that would have really helped us to understand the current situation we find ourselves in today. The film was based on a book that was written by John Sutherland and published a year after his death.\nThe film tells the story of Sean Mercer, a hard working young man from Yorkshire who is married to Mary and they have a son called Martin. Unluckily Sean is a man who makes the mistake of asking for a pay rise, after he had been told that the company were looking to take on the work that his boss was doing. That mistake turns quickly into disaster when Sean is unceremoniously sacked with no warning, leaving his family without an income. With his job the life is also taken away from him with only a bleak damp grey factory as his new scenery and he ends up working in a job that he has no experience in or qualifications for. Things begin to get a little better for Sean when he lands a new job at a local railway signal box. However it is all too short lived as he is called out on an emergency at night with his son going out to help an injured worker, where he is tragically killed and the story turns into a race against time to get to his wife and see if they still have a future. Despite the tragic turn, the film shows the best of the human spirit at the time that when we pull together that we can rise above the terrible situations that we find ourselves in.\nThe film is very much as bleak as it should be for the characters and there is hardly a ray of sunshine to lift the spirits. The film was released a year after Callan, another bleak film that told the story of the untold violence and hostility that the working classes where subjected to by the government and the press at the time. The film does go to great lengths to pull out all the gory details that are associated with the coal mining industry and show the horrible turn that can occur when you are faced with the brutality of unyielding authority. This is an aspect to the film and the real life character is very much as important as the characters that we have seen from the Hollywood portrayals of miners. It is a little surprising that the film has never had a release on DVD, in a way it is probably for the best because the film could have been lost to time and now people could see exactly how bleak the times were. The film doesn\u2019t just show Sean\u2019s life and his struggle to cope with the loss of his son, the world is shown to be a bleak dark hole where the only things worth working for is to keep yourself alive.\nThe film has the classic set up of an innocent man being caught up in some kind of situation that they do not fully understand. They soon find themselves at the mercy of a corrupt system that is looking down on them without a caring thought in the world. Boorman shows their suffering and how they pull together to see if they can somehow fight the odds that stacked up against them. The film is well acted by a cast that would have starred in television drama at the time and the cast were all experienced enough to know that they were involved with important film. There is also an amazing theme tune to the film that really gives the film a feel the real film. The characters are what really make the film work and their resilience in the face of adversity is what you really pull for.\nThe film is based around a true story and John Boorman had the foresight to see a film that would show the working classes with the struggles that they went through to just survive when it came to life at the time. This film really should have received an award as a way of saying thank you for telling the real story behind the working class struggle and showing another side to the industry. There is little glamour in this film, in fact I would say that it is just the opposite as it shows the harsh reality of", "label": 1, "id": 100880}

Tier 1 is the lowest grade and Tier 3 is the worst. Tier 3 countries are subject to a range of sanctions including suspension of non-humanitarian, non-trade related US Government aid. There are only 4 countries with Tier 3 status: Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\nSection 107 is an exclusion on the TIP report about the country's law enforcement capacity. The US State Department has no problem with Vietnam.\nSection 111 is an exclusion called Tier Placement regarding whether or not Vietnam is a Tier 3 country at the latest point of the report being compiled. Vietnam was not a Tier 3 country in 2006 or 2007.\nAs I recall from the 2007 TIP report on Vietnam, there were no specific Vietnam facts cited and there was no Vietnam country profile, which is available for many other countries.\nTier 2 ranking is for countries that are making some effort against human trafficking but have significant problems with the crime such as the government fails to investigate, prosecute and punish offenders. In 2009, Vietnam appears in this category.\nAs for the specifics of Vietnam's 2009 TIP score, the US State Department cites information from its own internal and government officials in Vietnam and Vietnam-based NGOs to the effect that the Vietnam government is \"ineffective\" in combating sex trafficking and that corruption continues to hamper Vietnam police efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes.\nBased on the Vietnam-specific assessments of these conditions, and in the absence of information showing otherwise, there are reasonable grounds to conclude that Vietnam is a country \"that is not in compliance with minimum standards established by the TIP [Trafficking in Persons] 2009 for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with those standards\"; making it a Tier 2 country on trafficking in 2009.\n\"TIP 2009 Tier 2 ranking is reserved for countries that have governments failing to meet their commitments to address trafficking and protect victims of trafficking by not meeting the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's (TVPA) minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.\"\nThis is a Tier Placement in 2007 where countries not already listed as Tier 3 may be placed based on the availability of other information, including assessments or reports by non-governmental organizations and/or media accounts.\nVietnam was placed in Tier 2 in 2007 as a Tier Placement. The Tier Placement in 2007 is the first time Vietnam has appeared on the Tier 2 list, and Vietnam now appears on the Tier 2 list again for 2009.\nThis is the \"Government responses\" section.\nFor Vietnam: \"The Government of Vietnam made progress in combating trafficking in 2008, especially in identifying trafficking victims and referring them to government shelters, but trafficking victims continued to face long-term institutionalization in Vietnam's social welfare system.

It also includes many small, independent film studios such as Miramax, Sony Pictures, and Warner Bros. Although Hollywood, in Los Angeles, has been historically considered the center of the motion picture industry, companies, such as Apple, IBM, Verizon and others, have begun to use their marketing influence to open offices in cities such as Brooklyn, Berlin, and London.\nMost major motion picture studios own theme parks as a way of enhancing their brands and promoting the movies they have in production. However, with the decline in DVDs and the rising popularity of streaming services, the rise of Hollywood's major theme parks has begun to taper off as has the rise of all amusement parks. In recent years, as part of an all property revitalization plan, several motion picture and television studios have started building theme parks in areas that house the studios. These include the Walt Disney Company's Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.\nThe television and radio industry is also centered in and around Los Angeles and New York City, with the two major American broadcast networks located in both cities. Most large cable networks are also located in these areas with Turner Broadcasting's head office and MTV Networks located in New York City, while many other smaller cable networks are headquartered in Los Angeles. In the television industry, the city of Atlanta, Georgia has become home to many scripted dramas, sitcoms, and animated series as its state subsidies for productions have made the city increasingly affordable for productions, with more than 25 television series filmed in the city as of 2016.\nThe music industry is divided into several different sectors, including record labels, radio stations, audio equipment manufacturers, music publishers, retail store-fronts, and artist managers. Although most of the major music labels are headquartered in New York City, large parts of the industry are also based in Los Angeles, such as the Universal Music Group and the Interscope Geffen A&M Records division.\nOther major music industry companies, such as Capitol Records, have headquarters elsewhere. Capitol Records is based out of Los Angeles, while Warner Music Group is based out of New York City, and Sony Music Entertainment is based out of Midtown Manhattan. Record labels do not usually own recording studios but rather rely on independent recording studios outside the studio that are not owned by record labels.\nThe United States also produces more independent films than any other country, with some of the top film schools being found in states like New York and California. In the United States there are a host of independent production companies, television stations, film studios, radio stations, sound production companies and other media companies such as PBS (a major public television station), HBO, Netflix, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

{"text": "this paper presents a novel method for determining the probability distribution of a time series model using sample average of a large set of time series instead of using a full Bayes factor for the final comparison with the proposed model. This method is applied to the analysis of a large dataset of the interferometric data from solar observation missions and comparison of different non-stationary time series models is performed. The main objective of this work is determining the most appropriate model among the competing candidates. In order to do this we need a method to find the relative probability between the different models, this is the main challenge of this work. In order to perform this task we apply four different methods; 1. Full Bayes factor, 2. Sample average, 3. Kullback Leibler and 4. Bayes risk, to compare the relative probability of two models given the data. Using one sample average is used in most previous work. In this paper we show that this method has a major deficiency in that it can give incorrect results if the population is large and the data is too sparse. In this situation, using only one sample average may give unjustified conclusions. We demonstrate this situation in the results section where we show that in some cases using only one sample average can result in the model being a poor choice when the probability it has relative to any other model is 99 percent. In the second section, we introduce a two sample average technique which is a simple extension of the one sample average technique introduced in the first section. The main idea is that a full Bayes factor cannot be found, because it is usually too large (numerically infinite) or zero which is undesirable, so a series of noninformative priors is used to ensure feasibility. Therefore the use of noninformative priors requires a change in the sample average calculation. This problem has been tackled in the past by either using improper priors where the posterior becomes flat and unhelpful or using specific sampling methods, a more suitable method is used here based on a simulation technique. The simulation is used to generate data using the model to be compared with sample averaged from the observed data. The posterior is then constructed from the resulting data. In order to generate noninformative priors, we consider a Bayes risk instead of a Bayes factor for the model to be compared and a general form of the sampling method is obtained. Using the noninformative priors, a suitable sampler, and the general form of the sampling method, it is shown that using the same noninformative priors for each sample in the sample average calculation gives good results. The third section applies this form to different non-stationary time series models of solar data to determine the relative probability between each model of the same system and each other models. The main idea is to estimate how well the model describes the data, and use this to determine how suitable it is. The aim of finding which model has the highest probability as is the case with most recent approaches based on full Bayes factor, instead we use prior information to aid the prior in the same way that in the past a flat prior has been used for improper priors where all other information about the sample is unrelated to the model. We show that by using our form we can obtain higher probability values by selecting the model that gives the best fit on the observed data, rather than the model that performs best in terms of information criterion, i.e. Aikaike information or K-L. We consider four different non-stationary models, each of which has been proposed and used in previous work on solar data. In terms of information criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Aikaike Information Criterion and Kullback - Leibler Divergence, all show that the best fitting model is the Markov Chain model. However using the same prior for each model gives different results due to the specific sampling methods and the noninformative priors as previously discussed. In conclusion, the main aim is to provide a united argument in the analysis of the large datasets in the interferometric observations of the Sun. This paper suggests that this sample average technique is superior and more robust and more effective and is easily applied to the analysis of the data and in many situations may give significant advantages. The use of data in a Bayes factor analysis as in the past, can give misleading results in that, the full Bayesian factor is numerically infinite or zero which can give a model that is highly unlikely to be a best fit. Using a simple extension to solve this problem of using noninformative priors, can significantly improve the use of the Bayes factor in the analysis of the data obtained as a result. This has numerous applications in a large set of time series data analysis problems.\nurn:nbn:se:bth-8259 (URN)", "label": 1, "id": 100884}

It was a good experience on many levels, but nothing clicked with my curiosity.\nIn my professional career, I have had a variety of jobs in different industries, from financial services to healthcare. I tried to do work that I believed in and that I was good at, with a focus on serving the clients\u2019 needs and ensuring their success and satisfaction.\nI joined the Tory Burch Foundation to do similar work in the social sector, particularly helping women launch and sustain their own businesses so that they, their families and their communities can thrive.\nI learned during my career that the intersection between business, service and social justice is fertile ground for entrepreneurs to innovate. Businesses that have an element of service to their enterprise tend to flourish by doing good in the world. Consumers become fans of a brand when it is doing good and they can align with that work.\nHow have you, personally, been involved in entrepreneurship?\nI am a lifelong entrepreneur.

How does a change in leadership or the community around a program affect the day-to-day?\nWe are dealing with these inevitable challenges that are part of any organization, and trying to learn from them.

I remember being successful and taking home the amount of money that I worked to earn \u2013 I could buy the house that I wanted and my daughter was able to go to private school. I was thrilled with my success but I also remember having that little fear of the day that I would have a hardship. Having that security of taking my success as well as my little girl and feeling like my family is safe.\nMy third success moment in business was when I started the company that I bought out of and selling it to my husband. I\u2019m not an entrepreneurs first and foremost \u2013 I\u2019m a businessperson. Some people will tell you that they are entrepreneurs first and the business comes second. I am a business person first and entrepreneurs second \u2013 sometimes we call our self \u201csocial entrepreneurs\u201d and I\u2019m fine with that. I like that language, that term. But I see entrepreneurship as an extension of the business side of you \u2013 we\u2019re trying to build up our community and get a return on our community\u2019s investment.\nMy next greatest success moment was when our TBF program was named a Top-Rated", "label": 1, "id": 100885}

However, the new plan is a positive step, as it marks a strong willingness by the german government to cooperate internationally, with the aim of improving the management of the refugee crisis.\nAccording to the german public television station r t, refugees currently represented 1.23% of germany s population, as of last december, despite the fact that the real number is estimated to be much higher.\nThe german government expects many refugees to return home in the near future, and wants to improve the situation of those who stay in their country of destination. As part of the european union s asylum, migration and integration fund ( eu aid ), 200 million will be dedicated to the support of people from war-torn countries as they settle in europe.\nThe eu will use 850 million euros for all programs within the eu s external borders security funds and 1.2 billion ( 750 million euros from the eu, to be combined with 450 million euros from other countries ) for the humanitarian support of refugees and asylum seekers residing in the eu.\nThe new commitment is the result of a negotiated position among the 28 member states, led by the current holder of the eu s rotating presidency, cyprus. This money will focus on improving the legal status of refugees, asylum and integration, which are often inadequate, and on strengthening programs for improving the living conditions of refugees and asylum seekers.\nFor this purpose, the plan provides for the creation of an asylum assistance and legal support program, coordinated by the european c ommission, aimed at helping refugee families who cannot return to countries where they came from or are not allowed to do so.\nThe assistance will be given to the countries in the eu, but also to their counterparts in the balkans, north africa and the middle east.\nIn this regard, the german government has expressed its readiness to provide 100.5 million euros for the creation of an emergency resettlement assistance program, to facilitate the repatriation of refugees and the voluntary return of illegal migrants to their home country.\nTo support the countries on the edge of the eu s external borders, 1.17 billion euros will be used to support humanitarian needs, such as reception, assistance and integration of people that have escaped from their home or are fleeing the violence that accompanies migration phenomena from their countries of origin.\nEuropean commission president Jean-claude juncker spoke of a plan that was ready to be used as soon as needed. He also said that for the first time money dedicated for migration and asylum will focus on the humanitarian needs of those who have already been helped.\nAlong with this agreement, the european commission has also decided on how to spend another 350 million euros, according to diplomatic sources consulted by agence france-presse. 150 million of this aid will be provided to the countries on the balkan european route, in order to improve the humanitarian assistance there.\nThe funding has been already authored and will have to be approved by the next council of the european union in late February.\nThe source told news agency aft that german chancellor angela merkel and vice-president of the european commission task force on illegal migrants and refugees Valdis dombrovskis had held a meeting with several members of the european commission, on january 24.\nDuring the meeting, the officials discussed how to ensure a strong european leadership on the migration crisis and the support of the fund for the humanitarian needs of refugees and asylum seekers.\nAt the beginning of this year, the german chancellor also suggested setting up a single fund, involving all eu member states and coordinated through the european commission and the european bank for re construction and development ( european investment ) to support all projects aimed at improving conditions in countries on the balkan route, with particular attention to the support of local communities, which are the first to be welcoming refugees in the crisis.\nThe president of the european council, Donald tusk, as well as the vice president of the european commission,sylvie guillme, and european commissioner christos sta kouras, who is in charge of humanitarian aid, were appointed as coordinators of this new fund on febru", "label": 1, "id": 100889}
{"text": "The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her birth town after having left to escape the tragedy she had inherited from her parents; her mother drowned in the lake and her father went mad and committed suicide. She was brought up by her uncle, the sheriff. The story shows how she manages to reestablish her relationship with her mother through a pact where they travel the nights searching for spirits. Tory discovers, with the help of her uncle, things about the tragedy with which the women of the town are afflicted and which seem to have to do with a curse. She falls in love with her childhood friend who has always been devoted to her, but is afraid of loving her too much for he is convinced that she will leave him, as both her parents had done. Tory discovers that she can bring dead people to life and that her mother really wants her to help women at the lake, who are afflicted by a curse, become free of it.\nThis story is so interesting and engaging that once started reading, I could not stop. As you would say, I felt totally engrossed in the story and the feelings of characters so much, that I almost felt that I was part of the story myself. This book was so addicting, I was lost in it; I did not even think of anything else once I started reading it. For that, I think it was a very well-crafted and well-written story.\nThe characters are very believable and the writer describes them in a very expressive manner. Through the book, the writer manages to make characters like Tory, the protagonist, so attractive, sensitive, funny, loving, compassionate, humble and intelligent, that I was immediately taken by her. She is one such strong, beautiful and loving girl, that I felt proud to know her. I found her attitude to people and life very impressive, how she was able to take care of people\u2019s feelings without getting hurt herself. She has the same kind of attitude that people generally associate with men rather than women. Tory as a character, is so strong and courageous, I found her role in helping the people and the way she did it, very inspiring. The writer manages to make character of Tory so empathizing that, I wanted to know her better, I wanted to get to know all those around her, know everything about them. The other character, with whom the story revolves, is her love interest, Kyle. Initially, he is not a likable character, but after a while he evolves into a character that becomes very close to heart. He was so funny and charming, I became fond of him in no time. All in all, the characterization was brilliant and the author has managed to make all the characters very well-defined and expressive, this story is like a roller coaster of emotions where it takes you from happiness to sorrow. Tory and Kyle are such a very charming couple, you can\u2019t help but become fond of them. Tory as a character was very special, she is very understanding and a compassionate soul who helps who help others around her, she is also very intelligent, she is well aware of the situation and works carefully on every situation. When I had read the last part of the book, I did not want the story to end, I was very disappointed when I reached end of this book because I wanted to know more of Tory and Kyle\u2019s life. Because as much as I liked reading about them, reading about Tory\u2019s life and her struggles had fascinated me, reading about the way how she helps women out with their personal matters, it was such an inspiring story. I was amazed how easily the writer describes the romance between a woman and a man, they both have such a beautiful romance between them, that I did not even feel the need to find any flaws in the romance of Tory and her love interest.\nI loved the love story Tory and Kyle develops. This romance was so beautiful and unique, it is so unlike the kind of stories and movies that we normally read. The romance develops very naturally for Kyle and Tory. It was not like any other romance, because this story is so unique that the characters fall for each other, because they need each other, these characters needed each other. I loved Kyle and Tory both as a couple and as individuals. Kyle was very fun, he was a perfect gentleman and the way he treats Tory was so sweet and tender. Tory was a perfect partner for Kyle; she helps him in every possible way. Kyle is an amazing man", "label": 1, "id": 100890}

Mean macular thickness in glaucomatous eyes was greater\nthan in the control group (6.89 mm vs. 6.51 mm, respectively, ), and macular\nthickness was greatest in the non-glaucoma eyes (7.54 mm). The mean macular\nthickness values in glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes were,, respectively.\nMacular thickness\nwas related inversely to BCVA and significantly to IOP and optic disc\ncannulae area. Conclusions Macular thickness with optical coherence tomography is\nhigher in patients with glaucoma than in those without glaucoma, regardless of age, and is\nlowest in non-glaucoma eyes. This trend was significant in glaucoma eyes, but it did\nnot hold in the group of patients without glaucoma. In a smaller subgroup\nof patients who underwent intraocular pressure measurements and optical coherence\ntomography imaging, macular thickness was also significantly correlated\ninversely to intraocular pressure. Therefore, macular thickness appears to be a\nmeasure of anatomical damage that increases with age and progresses gradually in\nthe presence of glaucoma.\nKeywords: Optical. coherence\nimaging Macula Glaucoma\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging tool with high\nspatial and temporal resolution, and it has been used in many areas of ocular\nresearch [1]. OCT can be used to measure axial, radial, and temporal structural\nchanges in intraocular disease. One of the most significant applications of OCT\nhas been glaucoma imaging [2,3].\nOCT has been recently used to measure the macular thickness, especially in\nthe investigation of glaucoma, but little information is available about the\nrelationship between the value of optic nerve head (ONH) structure and visual\nfunction [4-7]. Theoretically, if structural macular changes are related to pathological\nchanges in the ganglion cells and nerve fiber layer (NFL) with which the\noptic nerve is in direct contact, the macular thickness in glaucoma patients may\nbe greater than that in non-glaucoma patients [8-10]. The macular\nthickness may become an important parameter in the diagnosis of glaucoma and a\nmethod of early detection.\nIn the initial report, the macular thickness in glaucoma patients was\nhigher than in eyes with normal optic nerve head imaging [11,12].\nSimilarly, macular thickness was higher in glaucomatous eyes than in healthy\nor normal eyes in other studies [13,14].\nIn a study performed in our department, some glaucoma patients with\nprogressive damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer had lower macular\nthicknesses than did eyes with no or minimal damage. It is, therefore, possible that\nmacular thickness could be an early indicator of damage to the retinal ganglion\npale. In an attempt to clarify the relation between macular thickness and\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) on glaucoma eyes and in eyes from a control\ngroup, we evaluated the variations in macular thickness in patients with\nmaculopathy and in the control group. In addition, we evaluated the correlations\nbetween macular thickness and age, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)\non ophthalmologic examination, and the presence of glaucoma, based on IOP.\nCategorical variables are reported as frequency and percentage.

{"text": "Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because of the fact that it is about tech bros in Silicon Valley. I really enjoy watching technology geeks and nerds succeed on screen, so the combination of an interesting love story and some nerds working in tech made this movie really attractive for me.\nAnthony is a Silicon Valley programmer who works for a tech giant in the Valley. He\u2019s living together with his best friend Mike and working every day on the next iteration of a mobile app that lets people \u201cswipe\u201d potential life partners. One evening at a party, Anthony is confronted by the girl in the next barstool, whose name is Ashley. In a haze of alcohol, he decides to swipe her, and she responds positively as well. From that day on, they start to see each other. However, neither one wants to start a relationship due to some personal issues they have with themselves and other people in their lives.\nBut soon they start dating and things get complicated. Anthony has a best friend, Mike, who just broke up with his girlfriend, so they\u2019re all still sort of dealing with their respective losses. Anthony gets a new, exciting job and this leaves him increasingly conflicted about his future, his career and the possible future with Ashley. And Ashley herself has a lot of things going on her life, too, such as whether or not someone should get a divorce or not, or where to live and things like that.\nYou see, I found that very relatable, because we all have these kind of unresolved issues that don\u2019t necessarily come to a head. We\u2019re all trying to do our best and figure out our lives. I loved that this movie shows you two people in their early 30s that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing with their lives or where they\u2019re going next and that they really have to sit down together and go through all of this stuff. You have a guy who\u2019s sort of an entrepreneur and just can\u2019t settle down \u2014 you have this crazy-good coding background and he\u2019s thinking about how his parents will say when he takes a step like this [with Ashley]; you also have an architect who is married and who is actually getting a divorce but isn\u2019t ready to just dive into it completely. So this whole movie is a study about the life of people who are still figuring out their lives, while facing these sort of major crises in other areas of their lives.\nWhat also was fascinating is that the two main actors \u2014 Jesse Plemons and Maya Rudolph \u2014 are married in real life. I found the chemistry they developed on screen to be very convincing. It shows that, especially with a couple in your 30s, it takes a lot of work to make something work. You sort of have to face the music and be honest and really talk about the issues and the problems, so I thought the relationship on screen was really well developed. I also thought it was amazing how the movie explores issues like \u201chow do you deal with your past?\u201d and \u201chow do you deal with the people you love in your past?\u201d as well as \u201cwhat about your family \u2014 do you stay in touch with your past or live fully your life?\u201d. And the whole thing with technology and the mobile app was just fascinating. Ashley really enjoyed the app and saw it as a tool to find love. But also, I noticed that there aren\u2019t anymore people in relationships that meet at bars. They all seem to be on some online dating site that has them using their mobile devices to meet other single people. So I thought it was really nice to see that there\u2019s a kind of alternative way of meeting people to explore romance.\nSo, let\u2019s see! I\u2019m really curious to hear about other movies you\u2019ve seen lately \u2014 what are your favorite Netflix titles nowadays? Share them in the comments below.\nI\u2019m not a movie buff, but I did like this movie. \ud83d\ude42 Maya Rudolph is definitely a talent to watch.\nI recently saw the Netflix Originals The Perfect Date. It is light-hearted, funny, with a lovely romance. But the romance was not a big deal compared to the comedic value of this movie. I think the 2 movies are quite different.\nThe Perfect Date was a cute show and I\u2019m looking forward for the second season.\nThanks for stopping by! I\u2019m glad you liked my article.

It starts off as, yes, a little 2D romcom, but soon evolves into a story about relationships of the platonic and romantic variety. The cast is full of people you might not recognize, and the movie has an awkwardly funny sense of timing, in both the dialogue and the use of sound effects, which you can tell is coming from a play. There is also an interesting way director Kevin Allen treats the relationship between the main character, an overly anxious and self-hating film composer, and his sister. I found the movie engaging, and I\u2019d like to see more from Kevin Allen.\nHad no idea what the title meant until the end. I thought it meant something to do with darts, or maybe golf. Apparently a bouncing ball. It\u2019s the story of the world\u2019s greatest darts player. It takes place in the eighties and features the music of the time, in the same way that Goodbye Lenin did for the nineties. So there\u2019s a lot of U2, Culture Club, The Smiths, The Cure to throw back to back with the darts match. The world\u2019s greatest dart player of the eighties was actually a woman. It\u2019s a very understated movie that does not feature a lot of action. It focuses on the relationships within the circle of friends of the protagonist, a failed musician, who goes from being a nobody to having money, but losing everything he cares for.

So we say, \u201cHello, what\u2019s your name?\u201d And then they reply \u201cMatthew (or Joanne, or Joe, or whatever their name is), but I\u2019m also known as Matthew (or Joanne or Joe).\u201d And you can learn a bit about their background, where they\u2019re from and their history.\nWhat makes the project unusual is that people don\u2019t normally introduce themselves this way. They often have a name that people know or associate them with, but they always seem to have another, lesser known name and it\u2019s interesting to hear why people choose their particular name, so in a way, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working to uncover.\nThe audio is then transcribed and translated into the different languages, so a French speaker, for example, hears another French speaker say, \u201cHello. My name is Joanne, but I am also known as Marie.\u201d Then Marie hears another French speaker, so you have this sort of dialogue between two people, so one has the English introduction, the French translation, and then French-Arabic and French-Arabic translation.\nSo we\u2019re trying to create an international dialogue. Also, we want to be able to provide people with a sort of language learning tool, so in some sense, you can learn a new language in the same way that you would by trying to learn the language in a conventional way.\nIt\u2019s been amazing for me \u2013 personally \u2013 to become more involved in the French-Arabic language because I\u2019m not a linguist and I\u2019m not actually French. I\u2019m an Australian, but I\u2019m trying to become more aware of the relationship and the links between all these languages.\nAs Olivia says, hearing all the different languages has been fascinating. All these very different people are in the project.\nOne of the things I actually wanted to do in Golden Bough was to hear all of the different, weird languages that people use. In a way, that\u2019s like being at a festival; there\u2019s always different cultures.\nI\u2019m interested in different cultures, you know, in different languages because they all have their histories and they all contribute to what we see as our own cultures and languages.

We present a mechanism for exchanging messages between agents which guarantees the correct delivery of messages in the presence of asynchronous communication channels. The correctness requirement is that of a weak memoryless complete store where the message is guaranteed to be delivered at most one time period after it was sent. Furthermore, the amount of overhead is quite competitive: an overhead of 3 bits per character is added to each message. Thus, communication with this mechanism is no less efficient than without delays, except for situations described by a nondeterministic transition system with asynchronous and deadlock freedom.", "label": 1, "id": 100896}

It showed their true friendship.\nI would also like to add that this movie also makes me want to call a long time friend and check on them to see how they\u2019re doing. I mean who says best friend forever anyways? That is how true these friends were!\nA lot of the times, in today\u2019s day and age, people will say they are best friends or friends forever, but deep down they may be thinking, you\u2019re only a good friend to me while times are good and we get along with each other. Where as these two friends, Nick and Schmidt, proved to one another that they would be there for each other, for good or bad. They even made a pact, in the movie, that when one of them was in trouble, both of them would show up.\nEven though times weren\u2019t good for Schmidt, because of Nick trying to win over his girlfriend and friend to get her to like her, Schmidt still showed up for his friend. Schmidt\u2019s whole character is hilarious! At first, Nick thought he was insane with the way he acts. But soon he realizes Schmidt is a really smart guy with great advice. It made me want to check up on a long time friend I grew up with because he helped me through a lot of issues.\nMy other favorite character in this whole movie was Jess\u2019 character. Her boyfriend, played by Max Greenfield, is an idiot. In the middle of the movie he makes out with Jess and breaks up with her. WTF? Who breaks up with their girlfriends in the middle of the movie??! Whenever he made one of those moves, it was always followed by Jess getting really upset, not just looking hurt or not knowing what to say but really upset. Then Jess would go over to Nick, who would give her the right advice, just like Schmidt always did. Then Jess would go with Nick and end up kissing him and then bang! She and Nick were in a relationship.\nTo wrap up my review on this movie, I would have to say in the end that, whether you are friends, family or even best friends, be loyal to whoever you consider your friend! Your friends will be there for you when you\u2019re sick, no matter what.

But that was it and it didn\u2019t go beyond that.\nEvery other Asian kid I knew got bullied so badly for being Asian, that they had to switch school or get transferred somehow. For some they switched school and never looked back, for some they switched school so many times they ended up finishing high school at the same school they left kindergarten (lame). For some they got transferred to a school outside the predominately Korean or Chinese population and got more opportunities with less teasing. As I said, I was lucky. I went to school in Woodland Hills, CA (pretty much the suburbs), and it\u2019s pretty much 70% Caucasians.

Additionally, a penalty of $1,000 can be incurred for first-time offense, $2,000 for subsequent offenses. All owners who register their boats for the first time with the CA Boating and Aquatic Safety program, or who register a new boat without first properly placing the decal on their vessel, are exempt from the fee.\nThe law will take effect July 1, 2010, provided the funds are appropriated by the Legislature and the Governor.\n\"This legislation is a major step forward in protecting the California Coast from the debris that washed over beaches with the 1996 storm season. With storm events, we need to educate owners of all boats as well as other personal watercraft about the importance of cleaning all their personal watercrafts or boats before launching into a waterway,\" said Coastal Commission Hearing Officer for Region 6, Donne Brown. \"Educating the public and increasing public awareness and sensitivities to beach litter is important in the effort of educating them about the California Coastal Act.\"\nKehoe is a long-time advocate of preventing trash from littering California's beaches. In 2004, California Coastal Clean Up Day was created, a date which now falls on the second Saturday of every September. This year, more than 85,000 volunteers picked 3.1 million pounds of trash from California beaches and waterways.\nKehoe's efforts have been supported by both the Coastal Commission and the Port of San Diego.\nThe law is a part of the Senator's \"Bluewater Task Force\" efforts to reduce pollution, protect endangered species, and secure California's beaches from the onslaught of beach trash.", "label": 1, "id": 100899}
{"text": "There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, such Buddhism, and, later, Nestorianism, but they all failed to unite the Chinese. The Chinese people continued to practice the old religions, worshipped the gods, and burned incense at their ancestral altars.\nWhen Kublai Khan became emperor of China, there were already six important religions, each of which had a different philosophy. These religions were Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, Nestorianism, Christianity, and Islam.\nAmong the Chinese, Confucianism was considered as the native religion, but Buddhism was the largest religion in the empire. Buddhism came to China from India in the 1st century BC, and spread rapidly throughout the country. Buddhism has four fundamental teaching: (1) there is no permanent soul, (2) there is no absolute truth, (3) good works are the means of liberation, and (4) there is no God.\nAs for Confucianism, it came from the teachings of Confucius (551-479 BC). Confucianism had three fundamental teachings: (1) the world is good, (2) people should obey their parents, and then (3) all the different rules were to be followed, and people could reach to Nirvana by doing good works.\nBoth Confucianism and Buddhism made many contributions to China's culture. Because of Buddhism, China had more advanced philosophy, and it also introduced a more complex Chinese literature. In 1054, a major debate took place in China between Confucian scholars and Buddhists. Although Confucianism proved the stronger religion, the Buddhists eventually succeeded to take over the Chinese literati.\nIn 1279, a Catholic priest, Giovanni da Montecorvino, was sent to China as its first Papal nuncio. Pope Gregory X sent missionaries to China in subsequent years. However, the mission was unsuccessful, and a Nestorian sect was established in China.\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1461-1644), religion took a back seat to politics. The emperors imposed a national orthodoxy on the people of China. They prohibited certain religious practices, such as Buddhist monasteries. This allowed the religion to survive in clandestine form.\nBy the 17th century, Protestantism was growing in southern China. In 1605, Christian missionaries landed on the island of Amoy (Hainan). They were welcomed by the Hainans, because the Nestorian Christians had been there before. They established Christianity on Hainan. In the 18th century, the population of Hainan was about 1 million people. They formed an isolated society.\nIn 1698, some southern Chinese Christians came to Beijing to present their views to the Emperor Kangxi. They wrote to him: \"Our ancestors had believed in your ancestors; then they abandoned their belief in Buddha. We are grateful for your emissaries and others that brought our Holy Scripture to us for study. May you accept our religion and become our god, so that your throne may not be shaken.\" However, the emperor was not as welcoming to the missioners. He replied: \"Christians believe you have abandoned the teachings of Buddha and embrace Christianity. If you do not do this, leave my gates immediately!\"\nConfucianism was still the main Chinese religion but there were many sects, the most important being Taoism which was a mixture of Shamanism and Confucianism.\nShamanism, which is still practiced in the mountains of the southeast where there is a very remote and inaccessible population of Taoist-Shamans, is found in the northern borderlands and in Tibet. Shamanism is a type of religious practice in which the spirit of the dead are thought to possess the living to heal them or foretell the future.\nBy the 13th century, there was also a group from Islam that called Hui who were mainly traders.\nIn the 11th century, Islam was brought to China from the Arabs. A Muslim historian, Ibn Khordabeg, wrote about it, and that he believed Muhammad was a prophet like Buddha and Confucius. Later, Muslims spread throughout southern China.\nMost of southern China became Muslim by the 13th century. After Muslim merchants carried the religion into southern China, Confucian temples and churches were all converted to mosques.", "label": 1, "id": 100900}

Sky Digital remains one of the most advanced services, and the UK's top pay-TV service, with more than 8 million customers and revenue of \u00a32.91 billion as of 2009.\nThe first satellite service from BSkyB was the SuperVHS (Super Video Home System), a service launched in 1987 and closed in 1993. The BSkyB Sky+ service was the first digital video recorder (DVR).\nThe company owns the Sky News 24-hour TV news channel. In April 2007, BSkyB formed a joint venture with NBC Universal and the Discovery Networks in order to create a new joint subscription video on demand (SVoD) service, called \"Ask\" which was cancelled in 2010.\nToday, BSkyB now ranks among the biggest European pay-TV services in the United Kingdom, along with Virgin Media, which has 5.6 million subscribers and is now called BT TV. According to Ovum, in the last quarter of 2011, BT's market share of pay-TV market was around 45%, followed by Sky with around 55% market share.\nBT is the only UK telecom operator that offers its own TV service in competition with BSkyB, but BT's service is only widely available in London. Other than BT's TV service, BT is also the only operator in the UK that runs its own Internet service provider (ISP) broadband service.\nThe main BT TV service provides access to around 60 TV channels via a satellite dish or the BT Vision service. BT's BT TV service allows Internet streaming, as well as downloading and watching video through a BT box - similar to a Sky+ TV box.\nBT, along with Sky + TalkTalk, also provides the free TV licenses for customers.\nBT has recently expanded its business into content production, including shows like \"Midsomer Murders\" and documentary shows like \"Life of Mammals.\"\nIn July 2010, Virgin Media joined the European-based Freeview mobile TV service after BSkyB has joined the service in June 2010.\nBSkyB has also launched a new service called BSkyB Apps, and also BSkyB On Demand service.\nBSkyB entered into a deal with ESPN in October 2013 to launch BT ESPN in June 2014.

He was originally head of Channel 4 Television and later Chief Executive of the newly created Channel Five.\nBSkyB was a public company, until 2006, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought 17.9% of the company's outstanding shares for \u00a3940 million for a 15.6% equity stake. BSkyB's shares rose 5% on the news of the deal. In June 2008, News Corp. increased its stake to 17.9% of outstanding shares, giving its stake to 19.97%.

I'd like to say it isn't the ideal time but I guess I have no choice.\nI've read the thread and I guess you've already answered most of my questions in your own post. I have this feeling that we are very close. I'm definitely going to Australia as soon as I figure out a few things.\nOriginally Posted by gourav\nYou may or may not need to file an EOI, depends on your job. If it requires traveling often, it is likely that you will need it. You will be able to find out from your employer. I am not a lawyer or a migrant agent, just giving some advice based in my personal experience as an independent contractor\nLast edited by mrss; 22nd July 2008 at 07:43 AM.\nThe job in US does not require me to travel much because its a programming company for which I am going to work for for a month or 2. It is only temporary. And it's a short term job with a firm of US so it may or may not be of use to me for Australia.\nIs this the job in which you have applied and got the job through? If it is so, then it is likely that this job doesn't require frequent travel and hence should not be a hindranceto your EOI application. The second reason would be based on the nature of the job where the firm has no branches or offices in Australia and hence no international presence.\nThe firm itself says that it is a temporary job, and even in the contract it is mentioned. So it would be interesting to note whether the contract stipulates travel at all. I am however not the person who will go by the contract and take it for what it is, I'll dig deeper.\nHow are you going to prove", "label": 1, "id": 100912}

{"text": "Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and smoke release high heat, which may produce severe damage, if it is not properly controlled.\nA fire can start as a result of many different causes including faulty electrical installations, the failure to keep flammable items properly stored, or the improper disposal of burning material.\nIn this module, we will consider some of the major hazards associated with fires and fire prevention.\nA fire can be defined as any self-sustaining, rapidly burning chemical redox process, the primary and secondary products of which are air and heat, with a net consumption of oxygen. Fires generally fall into two broad groups: solid fuel fires and gas fuel fires. Gas fuel fires use gas fuel such as natural gas, oxygen, or hydrogen. Solid fuel fires use solid fuel such as wood, coal, or other organic material.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%, by volume) and oxygen (21%, by volume). Approximately 20% of the air that we breathe is oxygen; however, the concentration of oxygen is 20 - 35% by volume in open air at or near sea level. A fire of any size can consume approximately 75 times the weight of material in oxygen alone, and a small fire will continue to consume oxygen in this ratio until the fire is extinguished. This process can be described using a chemical formula (such as NOx or COx), and the process can generally be characterized as either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the reaction. The heat release of a combustion process may also be described using a similar chemical formula; and the heat release process can generally be characterized as being endothermic or exothermic, depending on the reaction.\nA very common cause of a large fire is the careless disposal of cigarette butts. This careless throwing of lit cigarettes butts have resulted in forest fires in South Africa and Florida. These forest fires can burn for hundreds of years because the cigarette butts continue to burn.\nIf the cigarette butts are on the ground near dry grass, the fire can spread into nearby houses. If the grass catches the fire, it can spread quickly to the forest. A single cigarette butt can start a very large forest fire very quickly in a dry area such as Arizona because very little fuel may be needed to continue the chain reaction leading to the spreading of the fire.\nWhen a cigarette ignites a matchstick, the flame is hot and can burn for an extended period of time.\nAn open flame must be surrounded by a fuel, but the fuel must be burnable to enable combustion.\nMany of the fuels for a fire could be considered solids, liquids, or gases, depending on how the material is stored and measured. For example, liquid petroleum can be measured in either a gallon, or a litre, but the concentration of liquid fuel (such as gasoline or petroleum) may range as low as 82.4 litres per gallon when measured according to ASTM D4814 (ISO 900:2005 11568), to the standard litre measurement (1000 ml) used by the United States Department of Defense (DOD).\nSolid fuels, such as coal, wood, and charcoal, are normally measured as a percentage of their volume in air to their weight in oxygen.\nLiquid fuels are measured by volume of fuel to volume by weight in oxygen.\nThe specific gravity of a solid or liquid fuel (such as liquid petroleum) is the measure of the density of the fuel when compared to the density of water (0.998 at 20 oC). The specific density of a fuel is defined as the weight of a given volume of fuel to the weight of a gallon-sized volume of water, at the same temperature. The specific volume of a liquid fuel is defined in the same manner as the specific gravity of the fuel.\nCigarette butts, and other organic trash, can spread fires caused by cigarettes.\nIf the fuel for the fire is dry and flammable, as in a dry rain forest, or dry wheat fields in Europe during harvest time, the combination of heat from the fire with the wind can carry the fire in the direction of the wind.\nThis will cause the fire to spread rapidly, especially if the fuel is extremely dry. In Arizona for instance, the fuel is often very dry, when compared to other places such as forests.", "label": 1, "id": 100914}

{"text": "hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized buildup of tissue within the dura mater, the membrane covering the spinal cord and other nerve fibers. The excess tissue causes compression and inflammation resulting in localized back pain and in extreme cases can cause tethering and a narrowing in the openings through which spinal nerves travel. This can produce a painful condition and lead to irreversible neurologic damage. This is also referred to as tuberculous meningitis.\nA.T. Steuart, 1911 first identified hypertrophic pachymeningitis. He reported a case of a 17 year old boy with progressive worsening left lower extremity weakness. He was a tobacco chewer at times during the day. He first noticed inability to stand due to his left lower limb being weak. Nerve conductions studies revealed a decrease in motor NCV in both upper extremities. The boy was unable to stand by himself.\nHe was admitted to the hospital and had a diagnosis of acute radiculitis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis. The onset of symptoms was 4 weeks prior to admission. He was hospitalized for 7 months but remained bedridden after treatment.\nHypertrophic dura mater encephalophayi is the most common form of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, occurring in 90% of reported cases. The cause is unknown, although a causal relationship has been demonstrated in most cases to the following situations:\nRecurrent bacterial infections of the ear, mastoid, sinuses, or nasopharynx\nAntecedent viral infection, such as Epstein Barr or Varicella\nThe diagnosis is often more difficult than that of other forms of dural disease such as meningitis or meningocele. There is a wide differential diagnosis of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, some which may mimic the clinical features. These include:\nSquamous cell carcinoma causing spinal cord compression\nInfection of the spinal cord (meningitis)\nBrachial neuritis\nTumor infiltration\nOssification of the spinal dura\nThese and other disorders can cause similar manifestations and may be responsible for the onset of symptoms. However, the specific cause of the symptoms and signs is usually evident following diagnostic studies such as cervical and lumbar PDW, myelography, and CT of the cervical spine.\nPatients usually present with 1 of three primary forms of disease:\nThe classical syndrome of progressive worsening of the left lower extremity and weakness\nThe acute syndrome, characterized by an abrupt onset of paresis of lower extremities often accompanied by an increase in the sensory level\nPatients with myelitis often present with an acute myeloencephalopathy due to a posterior horn syndrome\nPatients present with complaints of backache and paresthesias, often with weakness and neurologic dysfunction of the left side of the body. The onset may be abrupt, evolving over days to weeks, or it may occur slowly over several months. Patients often complain of pain that worsens on walking or bending backwards. Numbness, pricking sensations, and coldness are noted along the posterior aspect of the thigh, medial aspect of the calf, and sole of the left foot.\nAn examination may reveal the classic signs associated with hypertrophic pachymeningitis such as:\nLow-grade fever with rigidity at the site of pain\nTenderness over the midline superior aspect of the left buttock\nThe presence of increased or prolonged reflexes\nDeep tendon reflexes and plantar responses are more brisk on the right\nSigns of a spinal lesion may be present. These include:\nNeurologic findings include:\nLoss of function, depending on the degree of the tethering and compression\nThere may also be a neurologic deficit on the right in the form of a decrease in lower extremity strength.\nMyelographs and CT scans of the cervical spine are recommended with the following findings:\nNo or minimal compression on the cord seen on myelography.

The study set consisted of a total of 153 patients. The second set comprised healthy women and men as a control group. The control group, recruited from the general population, consisted of 402 individuals. All of the subjects were Han Chinese.\nFor the detection of the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism, Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed, which involves using single-step PCR containing two oligonucleotide primers, TaqMan probe, and Taq polymerase. The reaction was performed using a final reaction mixture comprising 12.5 pmol of each primer, 7.25 pmol of probe and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase using 25 mL of reaction buffer, 12.5 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl 2, 3 nM rDNA, 3.8 \u03bcg of BSA, and 1:100 dilution of genomic DNA. The reaction was incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and 40 cycles (denaturing step at 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds and annealing step at 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds).\nFor the genotyping of subjects, genomic DNA was extracted from 500\u03bc L of peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nFor each allele, we took the 95% confidence interval. Allele frequencies were compared by the \u03c72 test. The frequencies of both the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism and the combination 3S-23Ile genotype were compared between SLE patients and the control group using chi-square test.\nThe genotypes of 15 allele variants were detected in 250 subjects. The genotype distribution for the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism, for the 24 genotypes, are shown in Table 1.\n* In bold are 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotype frequencies that are significantly different between SLE patients and control individuals (p<0.05).\nThe two major genotype frequencies for the 24 allele variants were compared between the SLE patient group and the control population. The frequencies of the 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotypes were significantly different between SLE patients and control individuals (p<0.05).\nThe distribution of the 24 genotypes among the 90 SLE patients and 368 healthy controls was tested for association with SLE. No significant difference was found between SLE patients and controls for any of the genotypes. The combined frequency of the 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotypes showed an association with SLE.

The results obtained in this work showed that a single band was observed on the nonreducing SDS-PAGE, with a molecular weight of about 42 kDa or higher, which was in accordance with the reported molecular weight. Furthermore, the identification of two isoenzymes, with different pI, was also found. The isoelectric points obtained for the two isoenzymes were 5. 77 and 7. 30, suggesting similar structural features. The characterization of the isolated lectin using specific inhibitors revealed that the compliant lectin behaved as a serine, not a threonine, receptor. In addition, the results of immunochemo- graphy analysis showed that the compliant lectin specifically bound to a variety of pathogenic cell walls and hemidesmus morsus.\nChromosome aberrations are one of the most frequently used genetic damage indicators. There is enough evidence to support that the biological effects of radiation on cells are often expressed at the genetic level. The studies of chromosome aberrations indicate the genetic effects of ionizing radiation and the biological effects of radio- genesis, such as the cell cycle kinetcs, and they can be used in the estimation of the radiation dose. The aim of this study was the experimental evaluation of the induction of chromosomal aberrations in the cells of the radioresistant mammalian somatic cell line 10T1/2 and the estimation of the mutagenic activity in the cultures of plant species Solanum melongena L.

Revenue was up by 12% at \u00a31.88 billion.\nPete Waterman, the founder and executive chairman of Sanctuary, says that it has now restructured to remove non-performing businesses, and will now focus its property businesses on commercial business park developments in central and eastern Europe.\nSanctuary Group\u2019s operating deficit over the year rose from \u00a37.7 million to \u00a344.5 million, which included the exceptional costs.\nBut a small part of the exceptional loss of \u00a357.6 million relates to accounting policies changes, with an insurance claim and a write-off of goodwill in the Sanctuary Developments business.\nInvestors and analysts do not expect there to be an interim dividend this year. The company now has net debt of \u00a375.1m, at the end of March, down from \u00a3107.2 million in the previous year.\nThe company had previously said that it would take action to reduce net debt from \u00a3107.2 million last year to \u00a335 million by 2016 and to \u00a315 million within three years.\nIts development division had been hit because it was \u201cunderperforming\u201d. This had now been addressed by the restructuring, and Waterman said that \u201cSanctuary Property can resume its planned acquisitions programme from next year onwards\u201d.\nProperty development and management, including the development of commercial business and residential developments, amounted to \u00a3735.8 million, up from \u00a3690.0 million in the previous year.\nHowever, development property and land sales dropped from \u00a3186.7 million to \u00a367.8 million, and commercial and residential sales by more than 50% to \u00a382.0 million.\nThere were 159 completions during the year, less than in any of the previous five years - and 112 of these were residential homes in London.\nThe operating deficit on this development activity - excluding costs incurred in respect of the development of the 430-home Kingsmead development - was \u00a3118.0 million, up from \u00a320.3 million in 2014 and \u00a312.6 million in 2013.\nThere were 459 completions in 2015, the majority in the new Build to Rent rental brand Sanctuary Rural Living.\nMr Waterman said: \u201cSanctuary Group has restructured the business to be profitable and create value and the performance over the previous 12 months has shown the effect of the changes.\n\u201cThe board continues to assess the options and will make further significant changes to improve performance, which will involve changes to investment strategy.\n\u201cOur focus on the development of commercial parks in central and eastern Europe, combined with the Sanctuary Rural Developments business which has now refocused on small-scale development to build its pipeline, forms the core of the restructure for the group.\u201d\nMr Waterman, who used to own 25% of the company\u2019s shares and left the board in February 2014 after falling out with two other directors, now owns 11%. He had argued that there had been \u201csignificant mismanagement\u201d over the last ten years, while the other directors have denied this.\nThe board appointed an independent director as chairman two years ago, and appointed a new chief executive and a new finance director last year.", "label": 1, "id": 100924}

{"text": "Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the lateral and ventral view, with the dorsal (aboral) side elevated to form a tentacle ring, and the oral arms protruding anteriorly. Platyctenida live in burrows with a short, flat, blunt anterior end and the rest being curved.\nThe number of lateral plates in the cephalothorax and abdomen, as well as the number of oral plates on the first arm (2 or 4; 5\u20137 if the abdomen has a parapod) are used as diagnostic characters. The lateral plates on the thorax and abdomen of males are usually larger than those of females.\nPlatyctenida are predatory. In the absence of prey, they can also be parasitised by paranerine worms.\nMembers of the group are generally common in muddy habitats on the soft sediment. Their behaviour is usually subterranean (burrowing), but sometimes they can be found near the surface. Their burrows provide refuge from predators and also give way to their food resources. When threatened, they retreat back to their burrows and quickly close off the way out. The burrow structure is similar to other mud burrow-dwelling species, and is aided by the mucus secreted from the joint. This mucus may also help to attract predators in the absence of prey.\nIn addition to the mucus, water trapped in air spaces at the joints may play an important role in osmoregulation. For example, Platyctenus ceylanicus has three layers of mucus and air trapped between them, providing a highly permeable barrier in its burrow.\nThere are a few examples of burrow sharing, such as the case where two females of the same species buried themselves in the same hole to get a better chance of attracting males and avoiding the territorial behaviour of males. Also, there have been cases of two species of Platyactenus burrowing together in one hole but each species living in a separate chamber. A rare example that has been recorded is that of a Platyactenus living in a burrow shared by another burrowing worm species.\nPaleoecology[edit]\nThis group seems to be of Late Jurassic age, when they appear as a very diverse group. The group is more diverse in the Late Jurassic, possibly due to the emergence of new marine groups at that time. During the Cretaceous period, the group became more specialised, and underwent reproductive isolation, losing their ability to cross-pollinate with closely related species. The group declined during the Cenozoic, possibly due to the invasion of freshwater environments by land-dwelling arthropods.\nSubfamilies and genera[edit]\nThe following subfamilies are recognised[1]:\nEuplatyctenidae Oliveira, 1979\nEuplatycteninae Oliveira, 1979, type genus Euplatyctenus Rathbun, 1898\nPhaetoporinae Delle Chiaje, 1828\nPhaetopusinae Delle Chiaje, 1829\nPlatyacteninae Humes, 1873\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference[1]\n^ a b c d e f Dussart, P. 2009. \"Phylogenetic placement of Platyctenida (Lophophorata, Mollusca) and related problematic taxa: Revisiting the origin of the burrowing bivalves.\" In: Arnaud, B. and A.

{"text": "The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of a slide valve to control steam flow to the piston. To this end, the cylinder needed to seal against the block to prevent leakage. The piston rod now worked both the slide valve and the crank, and was double wrapped with leather to prevent sticking and wore at the point where the valve connected. The cylinder was now much higher than the block, and steam passed from the rear of the cylinder. This was called a \u2018Babbington\u2019 engine that allowed a low-pressure, continuous rotor to be attached to the crank, the piston itself now becoming a high-pressure rotor, working inside the cylinder. The rotor shaft ran longitudinally through the block instead of perpendicular to it. These engines were a giant leap forward in power output. This was the first realistic model for an engine for steamships as it allowed a high-pressure engine to be mounted below the main deck allowing it to drive an even larger paddle wheel which could push the ship through the water. There was no room for the engine to be within a paddlewheel case, as the paddlewheel would be mounted in the case. It was therefore necessary to build the wheel entirely out of metal, which considerably lightened its weight, but this also made it more brittle, and prone to fatigue.\nThe use of the slide valve was first used in 1809 by engineer John Cruikshank in a design to replace his existing rotative engine system on the ship HMS Hecla. However, the new design failed, the engines developing boiler and cylinder problems. This was not the end of his design though, but it was several years before he would succeed again and be ready to start producing a steamship to sell. In 1816 the HM 63, which also came to be known as the Sappho, was launched, the first vessel of its kind constructed to carry both cargo and passengers. Her propul-sion system had been designed by William Symington. This was the first successful rotary engined steam vessel, but still had severe problems with vibration in the bearings, and these were the source of constant breakdowns. The ship was a failure commercially and so there were now two types of ship, paddle steamer and steam sailing ship to the pre\u2013war stage.", "label": 1, "id": 100931}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and to identify predictive variables for PPH.\nMethods: This was a prospective, open-labeled, randomized study carried out in three tertiary care hospitals. The study enrolled women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. They were randomized to groups TXA plus (TXA+) or placebo. The primary outcomes were the rates of postpartum hemorrhage defined as blood loss > 1000 (1000\u20132000)mL and >500 (500\u20132000) mL, respectively.\nResults: A total of 289 women were randomized to TXA+ and 290 women to placebo. The demographic profile (mean age and weight) of both groups was comparable. The baseline hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL in the TXA+ group and 9.3g/dL in the placebo group. Overall PPH was 32.3%, 22.1% for TXA+ and 50.5% for placebo; and the rate of total blood transfusion was 31.8% in TXA+ and 66.7% in placebo group. The use of tranexamic acid was found to significantly reduce total blood transfusion and postpartum hemorrhage by 40.9% and 29.5%, respectively in the TXA+ group. Age \u226530 years, and increasing number of previous pregnancies had no effect on reducing PPH. In contrast, mean maternal preeclampsia or PIH, baseline hemoglobin (<9.7g/dL) along with increasing preoperative hemoglobin were associated with PPH in both groups.\nConclusions: Our results are significant as they establish TXA+ as a safe, simple, easy to administer, and cost-effective intervention to prevent PPH after cesarean delivery. TXA could substantially reduce the occurrence and severity of postoperative bleeding and could save costs and improve outcomes in women undergoing cesarean section.", "label": 1, "id": 100939}

And then there's all the amiibo themselves that don't do much.\nFor anyone who doesn't want to risk the luck of the dip with amiibo purchases, I would recommend just buying the bundles with a physical copy of the game in them if they are available.\nI'd advise against pre-ordering the Amazon Jpn ones since sometimes, the release date gets pushed back or moved up, and the date may not be accurate, but the other pre-orders I've seen so far are pretty good on quality and prices.\nAlso, amiibo, the NFC chips are used for the data transfer between them and the NFC compatible games, but the games themselves won't take up more storage since it can be transferred to the game's special data area after the amiibo/NFC chips are loaded with the relevant data.\nI'm surprised that more of the bundles aren't coming out with the games, or that they're being limited to a certain Nintendo 3DS system.\nStill, I do think that the bundles are likely going to help with the demand for the physical amiibo. I'm sure the bundles are going to move out fairly fast, but I don't think that they'll have much of an effect with the online sales in terms of easing supply issues.\nIt's just nice to finally have amiibo that fit the character aesthetic.

Meanwhile, the comedy was a relative ratings darling for the Alphabet on Monday, hitting a 4.4 rating in households nationally (making it the night\u2019s most-watched program, outside of NCIS).

The two-hour telecast of the show that stars Dermot Mulroney and Augustus Prew aired from 8-10 PM, with a 10.1/14 in 18-49, 15.33 million viewers and an 8 rating/14 share among adults 25-54. It skewed 26-49 (15.6 rating), which means a more narrow audience of viewers over the key demo that is younger.\n\u201cIt was great to see that we were consistent with our demo premiere of last year, and we also were very consistent with our audiences and delivered an audience and demo-friendly episode,\u201d said Kelly Kahl, CBS entertainment president.\nHe noted in some instances, including The Big Bang Theory, the show in their second season has done better in L+3, which measures streaming and DVRs. For Pure Genius, \u201cIt will depend on episode by episode,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our belief is that our younger skew audience will grow over time.\u201d The Big Bang Theory has now surpassed the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, which is a key demo for advertisers.\nTuesday is a night where CBS had two returning series, a new reality series Ransone (a cop show) and Pure Genius, so the network did add the 9 PM The Big Bang Theory special to its Tuesday lineup, with the show about to go down as one of the biggest in TV history. The TBBT special drew a 5.3 rating/19 share, 18.65 million viewers.\nThat series just got a renewal for a 12th and possibly penultimate season, while the premiere of Ransone did 7.3 million viewers and a 1.3 rating, and the hourlong show got a 1.4 demo.

In other words, a city such as Ponte Vedra would have to conform to Ponte Vedra's code.\nPonte Vedra, however, is in a different, more restrictive category, due to the fact it has developed much of the undeveloped tracts in a way not permitted by the city's comprehensive plan. City planners said this year that all of the city's land will have to be rezoned by 2005 to bring developments into line with the new zones, which will replace the 20-foot-wide-lot zoning currently in effect. One result of this process would be to force the elimination of some lots in Ponte Vedra now zoned as 36,365 and 36,303.\nIf zoning amendments proposed under the RPC program are approved, they would become part of Ponte Vedra's code.\nWhile the RPC program would not require Ponte Vedra property owners to tear down existing homes, it would force developers to build taller structures, in a city of low-rise developments. And it would result in Ponte Vedra developers having to pay more for lots.\nIf the commission adopts Ponte Vedra's RPC ordinance it would become part of the city's code, making the city more attractive to the RPC program than other Northeast Florida cities, but some Ponte Vedra leaders and officials fear it could also open the door for a state-regulated or even state-regulated and supervised form of RPC to be forced on them.\nNorth Florida cities, including Ponte Vedra, are not required by the state to have a comprehensive plan, but are encouraged to adopt them. Most have plans adopted under Florida Statute requirements, which would mean those plans would have to be revised by 2005 and 2008 under state law.\nPonte Vedra's comprehensive plan was created in 1990 but readopted in 1997 after being found by the Florida Department of Community Affairs not to be consistent with state laws.\nCity leaders fear the state commission's RPC program would make Ponte Vedra vulnerable to state control of local land-use regulations and planning.\n\"There's a real sense within the community of `here we go again,' \" said Bill Muckel, chairman of the Northeast Florida Legislative Delegation. \"The last time we saw something like where we're ending up now \u0097 20-foot-wide lots are about to become a thing of the past \u0097 there was a lot of resistance to rezoning everything from 30-foot lots to 36-, 37- and even higher on the back of residential property.\n\"That was when the last comprehensive plan was adopted. This is going to be a very challenging thing. If you're not going to go to the (Mason) Plan, you're going to run into the same kind of situation. This is going to be a big deal. Some of us (in Tallahassee) are reluctant to be a part of that process. If a decision is going to be forced on the city, we're going to find that very unsettling.\"\nCAN'T HURT TO SUBMIT THE PLAN\nWhile the city has not adopted an official position on RPC, some city officials have indicated that it, like Adena, believes that the time would not be ill-spent to make a submission because it makes Northeast Florida appear more welcoming to new private investment, economic development and job creation. It could also give Ponte Vedra a chance to get a foot in the door for RPC. City officials said a submission to the JCC would make it easier to get on RPC's radar screen in hopes of making it onto the list of select communities.\nCity officials have indicated a belief that the city's RPC-type plan is superior to any plan proposed by the Urban Land Institute, the private consultants' group.\n\"In my opinion, what we put forward already is superior to the Urban Land Plan in terms of our", "label": 1, "id": 100951}
{"text": "uncertainty around the value of and appropriate regulatory models for the new technologies and firms.\n\u2022 The industry is very competitive, with players vying for differentiation strategies based on product features or service characteristics. Product features in the short term are typically the most visible source of competitive advantage. However, the development of sustainable competitive advantage (which is achieved by offering reliable products with high quality standards, and by efficiently managing the value chain) requires a longer investment horizon.\n\u2022 In addition, the market for new energy technologies is still evolving. Increasing investment in the market (especially by large corporations in new fields such as energy storage, electric vehicles, solar and wind systems) has resulted in a shift toward an increasingly mature market.\n\u2022 The industry is regulated. Public policy seeks to ensure that a market for new energy is created and functions efficiently, providing the necessary incentives for long-term investment, particularly in R&D. Regulatory developments are at times disruptive, with significant impact on the industry\u2019s strategy and competitive advantage. This has not prevented competition for technological leadership or market share.\nAs an example of how the industry is regulated, in order to incentivize R&D the Brazilian government has, since the opening of the energy market, introduced various instruments such as specific research areas, research and development subsidies and technology investment tax credits for energy. Although the industry is becoming less regulated now, large investments remain to be made in order for the industry to become more efficient through the use of new technologies and the deployment of the best available technology.\nAs with other types of energy, there is a high level of uncertainty and the potential for market evolution with the introduction of new technologies, but there is also a lack of market definition and appropriate regulation on certain segments of the energy market.\nThis scenario has a high level of uncertainty, as there are several new products that are only at early stages in the market lifecycle. The Brazilian energy market has seen the entry of new types of providers of electric energy, such as IPPs, which are developing large renewable projects, with some of them becoming market players and entering traditional lines of business. Although in the short term new-to-the-sector providers of traditional electric energy are likely to focus on their mainstay businesses, it is expected that some of them will become active in the market in the medium term. The emergence of new categories of energy producers with their own business strategies that can compete with traditional players will alter the business strategies of traditional players.\n\u2022 The electricity and energy market is being regulated on the basis of the principle of competitive supply to consumers and on the basis of transparency on operating conditions (for example, energy prices) and on regulatory accounting principles applied to tariff calculation. These principles will change in response to new technologies, which could lead to further changes in rules of competition and regulation.\n\u2022 Another key factor determining the industry\u2019s evolution is technology. As new technologies become available they could introduce innovation and competition (for example, in generation and transmission) and change traditional business models. Thus, the use of new technologies requires a high investment commitment by incumbent providers to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage in the market and the development of innovative products and services that give it a competitive advantage.\n\u2022 As indicated in the previous section, there is a lack of clear definition of the Brazilian electricity market, which makes the definition of a business model difficult for large integrated incumbents (which are at risk of losing their competitive advantage over time).\n\u2022 Other important factors are the increasing cost of carbon emissions and the environmental legislation and energy efficiency regulation. The new regulatory framework for environmental liabilities (a new rule on contaminated sites in the electricity, gas and petroleum sectors) was adopted by the Brazilian government in September 2016 and entered into force on December 14, 2016. A number of electricity and oil and gas and gas generation and transmission companies will need to make provisions regarding possible contaminated sites, which will generate uncertainty as to the extent of future liabilities and will complicate the company\u2019s long-term planning.\nEnergy service providers are increasingly active in Brazil\u2019s electricity and energy market. Energy service providers use a range of activities aimed to help customers improve energy efficiency in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. This includes consulting services, which help companies manage their energy consumption, such as by adjusting lighting levels, refrigerator temperatures and temperature levels of servers.

They, in turn, when they were good she also kissed them good-night, or so their parents believed.\nHe explains that not everyone was as good as his parents believed and that he had an older sister in her twenties. He recalls that his eldest brother was ten years older than he was and that his sister was sixteen, so his age was twenty-four years old. The eldest brother, he says, was the favorite of La Cachipaya, so he wanted to be a doctor, but as time goes by he found out that he had to study a lot to get into the university, and he found that because he had to move to the capital, he would find it difficult to continue his studies. He explains that he was the only brother in the family with whom that woman was uncomfortable and, because he never understood the reason for being so, he found it easier to leave the family, and as a result, his mother suffered more. And that was after graduating from high school which his father, with great effort, was able to pay for him. He explained that the family did not have as much as they got from his brother, so since then they have had to go through many situations, so his mother started suffering even more and one day, suddenly, she died. He remembers what happened that day.\nThat day he came home and saw his father very sad. He sat on the sofa, and he put his left hand, his most visible one, on his shoulder, and he started to cry, so he went to see what was wrong, and his father explained that his mother had died and that they would be buried the next day. He was young and did not understand the death of the mother, what it meant at that time, what she has since been saying, what she is, is, and will be doing. He says when he was a child he did not cry if it was not because he played, that's it. I liked to play very much in those days and he would leave the house to play all the time and always returned safely without hurting himself. He says that he was a good boy, because even then he did not steal and he did not disturb.\nSwift Message says that as he grew older, his sister became a woman like this in the afternoon and that was a person who went out every day, did not sleep and would come in at dawn. If they could not go home, it was the housekeeper who gave them food until she came, and he explains that they", "label": 1, "id": 100955}
{"text": "since it is commonly believed that the observed large -scale\nanisotropy is not entirely of cosmological origin\nand due to real large -scale filamentation,\nit may be used to set limits on the power spectrum and the spectral index.\nWe use a large -scale filamentary system detected\nin the DEEP 2 South over -density to constrain the spectral index of the power spectrum of galaxies and the correlation parameter,\n$\\xi (s_{p})$, for $s_{p}= 100$ Mpc/h.\nThe result is compatible with all current limits,\nalthough it puts somewhat tighter constraints on the index of the power spectrum,\nindicating a spectrum close to $\\Omega_{m}^{0.6}$ of order 0.5 to 0.6 at 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc,\nin agreement with the results obtained using the local over -densities of galaxies and clusters measured in the\n2dFGRS survey.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe large -scale structure formation paradigm implies that the Universe is dominated by several non -gravitating and gravitating components.\nFor the non -gravitating components the baryons follow the standard evolution of a cold matter distribution, in agreement with the observed luminosity function and the abundance of metals, the large scale velocities and fluctuations, and the rotation curve of the Milky Way (e.g. Peacock 1983,\nDekel \\& Rees 1988; Carlesi et al. 2000 and references therein).\nIt is assumed that the contribution of non -gravitating sources to the gravitating component is negligible, i.e. the present -day gravitating components are the superposition of the density fluctuations of the past light -cone of the Universe, which represents, however, only a small fraction of the total comoving density fluctuations.\nIf we neglect the non -gravitating contributions one may identify them as the non -gravitating sources since gravitational collapse of overdensities is the only process which can build up overdensities and galaxies in the Universe.\n\nThis picture makes a crucial assumption on the density inhomogeneities: their spectrum over all scales is scale independent, and only modulated by a single parameter, the power spectrum of density fluctuations, $P(s_{p})$.\nThese density perturbations are characterized by a common comoving wavenumber $k = 2\\pi\\ /s_{p}$, where\n$s_{p}$ is the comoving radial distance of interest and of unity over the scales that dominate the density profiles of the fluctuations.\nThe distribution of over densities and substructures in the Universe depends also on the details of the merging and accretion histories of structures.\nAt a given $k$, the power spectrum depends in general on the cosmological epoch $t$,\nsince the perturbations have a physical origin at the radiation -dominated epoch (Gunn \\& Peterson 1967)\nand grow and evolve.\n\nAs a basic physical and observational property,\nthe density of overdensities is given by the spatial correlation function, $\\xi(s_{p})$,\nwhich, within the linear theory of structure formation,\nis predicted to be power -law dependent on the power spectrum of the density fluctuations $P(k)$\n(\\sc Zeldovich 1970, 1972; Kaiser 1984).\nThe power spectrum is the Fourier transform of the probability distribution function,\nwhich is a probability to find a linear perturbation of amplitude of order $k$ in a given linear volume,\n$dP = k^2 P(k) dk$,\ngiving $P(k)=\\overline{\\rho}k^3/[8\\pi^2\\sigma(k)]$\n(e.g. Fry \\& Peebles 1974).\n\nThe power spectrum of fluctuations is one of the fundamental cosmological parameters which represents fundamental processes such as the primordial spectra and initial conditions, the evolutionary stages of growth (peeling off of high wavenumber modes and the nonlinear evolution),\nand the scale- and epoch-dependency of the power spectrum\n(see e.g. Carlesi 2000a for a review).\nIt is also fundamental to modeling the properties of the observed galaxies\n(e.g. Bahcall et al. 1989, 1991", "label": 1, "id": 100956}

That means stadiums at all levels need to up their floodlights to a certain minimum before then.\nThe Football League and National League require clubs to install 500 lux 30m away from the centre line of pitch as a minimum for Category 2A status. Poole are currently at around 100 lux, and will have to invest \u00a370,000.

The first 45 minutes are completely ridiculous, in a good way. Sure, not much really happens, but it's just enough. It really is a blend of comedy and terror. You either love it, or hate it.\nYou're a fucking idiot. 2012 was way better.\nIt's so hard to rate this movie. I'd put it at a 7 - 8/10. The second half of the movie was a lot better because the humor was better. The humor itself was hit or miss. Most I found funny. However, it just didn't keep building up much of a laugh out loud reaction. I found this to be a real downer. The part with the alien autopsy didn't seem to make as much sense as the comic did. However, the pacing was quite good and the action very well done. The main problem I have with the movie is it's length. I think it could have been 20 mins shorter and the movie would have been much better.\nby FUCKFACE\ni liked the movie. at least the first half, where it's funny. the last half sucked. but hey... for an alien invasion of new york! it's fun.\nWow, it was great.\nGlad to see some of you finally admitting this might have been a genuinely entertaining summer block-buster.\nby fcumming.com\nWas this not one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while? A very rare blend of comedy / alien invasion / sci-fi. The best example being Willis's scene of the tooth. I didn't like him in the movie (his acting is over the top and forced) but that sequence was very funny. The movie is definitely overly long and would benefit from being 10 to 15 minutes shorter but overall it was very enjoyable.\nWas just going to post that.\nGotta love it, you know?\nMmm yeah...\nNo way! Some people thought it was good.\nby ronsen\nWell, it's good to see some positive comments about the movie. And you can add me to the list of people that didn't mind the extended running time at all (in fact I thought it could've been longer), but perhaps it had something to do with being the first movie I have ever seen that didn't force unnecessary dramatic pauses for dialogue that would've worked better as written on the page. I'm talking to you 300. Lots of talk about Willis's acting, but I thought he was perfect. Likewise with Jacked up Bruce.\nMelodramatic movie = good\nby mcge31\nDumb fun = bad. \"The Happening\" is a horrible movie. I guess this one's not too bad.\nIt's a comedy???\nOh, and the original short version of the movie had no Willis at all, because the ending just makes no real sense.\nThe ending makes absolutely no sense, and I'm gonna be brutally honest, but I can't believe that no one has complained about it yet in all the other threads, so I'll just say it: the ending made absolutely no goddamn sense. First of all, just after Willis saves a lot of people with his power-ballad, we're introduced to an extra-large, red-eyed, fang-toothed monster, and it just... runs away.

{"text": "a 37-year - old male presented with fever and jaundice. Liver biopsy from patient\u2019s liver revealed marked fibroinflammatory activity and sinusoidal occluding inflammatory cell infiltrate. The patient gave history of anti-TNF alpha therapy, but the liver biopsy was taken when he was afebrile. There was no clinical suspicion of acute hepatitis.\nWhat causes inflammatory hepatitis following TNF alpha blocker treatment?\nIf TNF alpha is critical for immunomodulation of liver fibrosis then blocking it might increase liver fibrosis. So, it was initially hypothesised that anti TNF alpha agents might accelerate liver fibrosis.\nHowever, on further evaluation, the TNF alpha blocking drugs are not associated with liver fibrosis acceleratioin.\nThe other proposed mechanism relates to the generation of antibodies (immunoglobulin G) specific to the TNF alpha blocking agent, the degradation of which might lead to the development of hepatic inflammatory reaction.\nHarmouni et al. in their study found that TNF alpha blocking agents may be associated with the development of autoimmune hepatitis, but were not associated with either sinusoidal inflammatory reaction or fibrosis.\nWhat kind of cell reactions in liver may mimic the inflammatory hepatitis?\nIt has been found that TNF alpha blocker drugs could lead to sinusoidal and portal inflammation in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis.\nThe pattern of portal inflammation appears to simulate inflammatory hepatitis (sinusoidal and hepatocyte inflammation along with portal inflammation).\nDrugs known to cause sinusoidal and portal inflammation are TNF or IFN blocking agents.\nWhat do you think is responsible for the occurrence of sinusoidal portal inflammation in anti TNF alpha drugs. What might be the mechanism? Which histological pattern would be expected?\nClinically, the patients on anti TNF alpha drugs may present with an acute elevation of serum transaminases, often with concomitant jaundice.\nThe portal inflammation mimics that of acute hepatic viral infections.\nHistologically, the liver will show portal inflammation as in parainfluenza infection i.e. hepatocyte inflammation, hepatic sinusoidal inflammation along with portal inflammation, which may lead to liver transplant.\nWhat do you think is responsible for the development of anti-TNF alpha antibodies?\nThe mechanism of the development of antibodies is not clear. The hypothesis is that the drug molecules have a similar structure to that of native TNF alpha. The liver macrophages and other antigen presentating cells phagocytize the drug- TNF alpha molecules and present these to T cells of the immunological system (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells).\nMacrophages and monocytes, as CD40+ cells, are primary recipients of TNF alpha molecules, which leads to phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the TNF alpha molecules. There is a hypothesis that the T cells react against these anti-TNF alpha agents, which degraded molecules of TNF alpha (different from that of native TNF alpha). This may precipitate the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis.\nThere is a possibility that these antibodies are responsible for the histological features observed on liver biopsy.\nIf there is a possibility that these antibodies are important in developing a patient\u2019s immune response, may liver biopsy be avoided before starting anti-TNF alpha drug therapy?\nIn light of the data, can the antiparasitic agent, pyrantel pamoate be recommended for use in patients on anti-TNF alpha drug therapy?\nPyrantel pamoate belongs to the group of nematode-specific antischistosomal therapy. It is also active against larval and adult of filarial worms.\nIn 2017, Dahmani et al. conducted a study to evaluate the safety of pyrantel pamoate in patients undergoing treatment with TNF alpha blocking agents.\nThe investigators found the use of pyrantel pamoate in patients receiving anti-TNF alpha agents (adalimumab", "label": 1, "id": 100960}

Mechanical measurements are used in laparoscopy to assess the degree of instrument insertion and to judge whether it is necessary to reposition the instrument in the field of vision. The objective of our study was to investigate the accuracy of the instrument measurement in a range of LESS Single-Channel Instrumentation Technology (LESS Single-Channel Instrumentation Technology instruments. This system consists of a fixed camera, a robotic system that moves the pendulum and two other endoscopic arms to allow the operator to perform minimally invasive surgical tasks. We also aimed to find a set of mechanical measurements that can be reliably repeated and easily applied by the user.Methods: We used an experimental rig with three arms to replicate mechanical measurements (the length of the inserted instrument, the angle the wrist is held at relative to the body and the distance the instrument tip is from the fixed point). We tested the accuracy of each measurement system during the insertion and retraction of the instrument (n = 10 for each). To verify the reliability of our measurements, we also tested the same instrument with the same measurement system (n = 10 for each) for different angles of manipulation. Results: During retraction with the instrument in the abdominal cavity, the distance between the wrist pivot and the probe tip was the most reliable method (reliability coefficient R = 0.964, p\n0.000). The length of the inserted instrument was the least reliable. Manipulating the instrument through a greater angle of rotation was also associated with greater unreliability with the length of instrument and the wrist position. During insertion, the length of the inserted instrument and the angle of the wrist position were not reliable, and the relationship between distance from the fixed point and the length of inserted instrument did not conform to the linear relationship as suggested by the theoretical model (R = 0.347, p < 0.000).Conclusion: None of the three mechanical measurements were reliable to measure the distance between the instrument tip and the fixed point, length of the instrument or the rotation of the wrist to a fixed point. The distance between the instrument tip and the fixed point was reliably measured (R = 0.964). However, future studies should still perform validation testing to determine the clinical utility of these measurements. Intra- and interoperator variability should also be measured through prospective studies.\nkeywords : Surgical Instrument, Laparoscopy, Single Incision\ndoi : 10.1089/bjp.2010.131", "label": 1, "id": 100961}

A single serum calcium level was compared with 14-month serial values in the subjects. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) concentrations were measured as part of a general screen for infectious and metabolic causes of hypercalcemia. In the 14 months of follow-up only 3 of the 22 hypercalcemic subjects (13.6% of patients with hypercalcemia) had normal serum calcium levels. In these 3 subjects, changes in serum calcium levels correlated more closely with concurrent changes in CRP (r = 0.4761; P < 0.001), CNP (r = 0.2775; P < 0.05) and creatinine (r = -0.2481; P < 0.05), than in subjects with hypercalcemia. CNP correlated negatively with serum free and total 25(OH)D3, whereas CRP and C-peptide correlated positively with these values. The results of this study suggest that a single serum calcium level is unlikely to disclose metastatic cancer and that, in subjects with metastatic disease, repeated levels with biochemical markers and physical findings are necessary to exclude other causes of hypercalcemia.

The current study was conducted to estimate the incidence and prevalence of CKD requiring initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) including peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. A retrospective cohort consisting of 147,135 patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy was constructed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database between 2000 and 2011. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was estimated by Poisson regression taking age, race, sex, geographic region, comorbidity scores, and cancer diagnosis as covariates. The cohort was followed until January 2014. During the observation period, 2096 (1.42%) patients developed CKD requiring initiation of RRT of which 1276 (59.6%) patients had HD and 820 (39.2%) patients had PD. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was 17.9 per 100,000 person-years (PY). Incidence of CKD requiring initiation of RRT varied by age, race, sex, cancer diagnosis, and geographic region. Incidence was lower in females (20.9/100,000 PY) than in males (38.5/100,000 PY) [P<0.0001] and in non-Hispanic whites (41.0/100,000 PY) than in non-Hispanic blacks (18.5/100,000 PY) and all other races [P <0.0001]. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was lowest in patients with lung, skin, and breast cancer, as well as in those receiving taxanes and platinum agents for cancer. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT requiring PD was twice that of HD, while the cumulative incidence of CKD requiring initiation of RRT requiring PD was lower in the younger patient subgroup (44.6%) than in the elderly patient subgroup (65.2%).

I\u2019m sure they will make a lovely blend.\nDorothy is only 18 months younger than her beloved Jack, but she says that having the three of them married and living around the corner from Peter and Helen Cochrane will make them a wonderful \u2018foursome\u2019. And I bet that\u2019s right, because as we know it is often two halves that make a whole.\nNancy and I did a bit of \u2018catching up\u2019 over the weekend and I mentioned that as some of us are getting married I would like to write about the age difference at weddings. After I married my second wife, who was the same age as me, I started to notice that people would ask me how many years older or younger my wife was.\nAnd when my second wife became ill I was often asked why I had stayed with someone who was so much older. So I started writing down what I could remember about conversations I\u2019d had and the responses I\u2019d had to that question.\nFirstly, my second wife\u2019s brother told me I should have married someone younger as I would have more in common with her in the \u2018present\u2019 and have less in common with her in the \u2018future\u2019. But I asked him to be careful because if we have children and they are married with kids when they are 35 years old, I would still have more in common with their children than I would have with them!\nMy husband died when he was only 53, and his age was very different to my age when he died. I guess it is easy for people to say they would have stayed with a partner if theirs died and then went on to start a whole new relationship. But if your partner is taken from you, when you have not taken responsibility for ending the partnership, how do you know what you would or wouldn\u2019t do. You don\u2019t have any idea really?\nI have always been an advocate of going \u2018with your feelings\u2019 because people are either comfortable or they\u2019re not and they know it. If you go with your feelings you will not go with the fear of what people will think.\nAnd I always say that if you were to go a whole life without living with someone that it would take you most of that life for you to really feel the loss properly and then have time, space and energy to be able to move on.\nIt may just be that I am a woman who has been let go by a spouse? Maybe I am just a little selfish in thinking that I should get to choose who I marry or if I marry again? Maybe? But also I say that it is about personal identity rather than age and sometimes getting married to someone younger is to give someone else an identity when you might already have a good one.\nIn my personal opinion it is also easier for a woman to lose connection with her body when she\u2019s had children.\nI was only 40 when my second husband died and I had had two children, so I think when I was ready to make it clear that I was a free woman I chose to start dating a man who was even younger than my husband was when he died. I also think that when we don\u2019t take out our anger on people we love when we feel rejected there is more energy to go further out into the world.\nWhen we meet someone new, it feels like they are new and we don\u2019t have any preconceived ideas, ideas that have been shaped by previous relationships, ideas of what we are looking for. We have space and time to think about ourselves as an equal partner and how much we have in common as individuals rather than as partners.\nThe reason I have", "label": 1, "id": 100966}

{"text": "Andy Moll was part of a three-man team exploring a cave system in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas with two friends (Jason Balling, Troy Bradner). At about 9:30 a.m. Balling and Moll began the descent into the cave. Moll and Balling did the descent first: At 1,500 feet Balling began to have trouble with some equipment. At 1550 feet Moll had to abandon the descent because the route had completely flooded over. He then went back up to warn Balling. A little more than an hour later Balling had gotten through, he descended to Moll and had a change, and went back up. At about 1 p.m. Balling descended into the cave to meet with Moll and Bradner to go back up. On or just after his descent Balling found the two of them but only Moll was there. Bradner had fallen and injured his back.\nIn his book Andy reported to Balling and went up the shaft; he returned to Balling and Bradner and brought them up. He then spent the night in the cave and the following morning headlamps were found near the entrance. Later in one of his many interviews he said that in the morning they looked for Moll as they went up the shaft but did not find him. The final expedition of the year was the Christmas trip with Balling and Bradner. On that trip they found Moll's helmet at the top of the shaft where they had originally met.\nThe next day Balling climbed into the cave to rescue his friend from a 700-foot chamber with water up to his chest. They spent New Years Eve in the cave. On January 1, 1980 Balling discovered Moll's body about a third of a mile (520 m) away.\nOn January 4, 1980 Balling climbed the 150-foot shaft into the cave to retrieve Moll's body. The body was retrieved, and Balling climbed back up to meet those waiting at the surface.\nOn January 18, 1980 the sheriff faxed (it's not entirely clear what kind of fax machine this was) a fax to a New Mexico caver in which it was stated that they would not accept searchers into the cave. As it turned out, the \"sheriff\" (Joe Spurlock) was a caver and knew the area fairly well. He never had jurisdiction of the caves, but he was the \"law\" on the surface.\nThough the investigation was carried out by the local sheriff, due to the size and significance of the tragedy, it fell to Spencer County Sheriff David Anderson to organize it. Spurlock, who was a caver and knew the cave area well, was tasked with the job of supervising the search operation. Spurlock, who had worked under Anderson for 27 years, also became a critic of Anderson's leadership of the investigation. In a local paper, he stated that \"Anderson didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground \u2026 I tried to stop him from making this big goof.\" He also stated that Anderson \"had zero ability to direct anything other than pissin' contests.\"\nInvestigators from the National Park Service, Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the U.S. Army Special Operations Command came in from out of state.\nAnother criticism of the investigation is the speed with which it was discontinued.\nOn January 18, 1980 a letter was mailed to the National Speleological Society (NSS) to request help in identifying Andrew's body. The letter was signed by Joe Spurlock but it appears that the letter was drafted by someone else because at points it is inconsistent with the sheriff's characterization of events, and it may be that the NSS official who signed it was simply doing it in his capacity as an official with the NSS. The letter contained an invitation to the NSS to participate in the investigation, stating that \"The State of Arkansas is asking assistance in locating a missing cave explorer/student who was at or in the vicinity of the 700 foot shaft on January 1. The assistance from the Association's expertise will be greatly appreciated.\"\nAccording to the sheriff's letter, Andrew Moll had been found the previous day by his two friends and his body recovered by the same individuals who were with him the day he disappeared.

There may not have been sufficient technology available at the time to successfully apply the new concepts of sleek airframes and powerful inline engines to this type of aircraft. To get there without first going through the \"classic\" aircraft stage with power plants like radials, inline engines would have required a quantum leap in engineering to build and maintain.\nBut it was the A6M that first brought the Japanese to the fore of the Pacific War, and is still remembered as a legendary aircraft because of Japanese propaganda, it's legendary appearance (including the ability for a \"Zero\" to perform a \"suicide dive\"), it's use in Pearl Harbor, and in some countries, it's reputation as a killer of Allied pilots. But the true picture is rather different.\nIn fact, with the exception of the P-51 \"Mustang\", not a single Allied fighter in Europe or the Pacific was killed by a \"zero\". It was a fantastic aircraft capable of outperforming the British Spitfire and American P-38 Lightning and P-40 Warhawk, and had the longest production run and the highest number of total units ever produced by Japan. But it's reputation for being a formidable killer and a great fighter was greatly exaggerated, in fact, the British found that a few well aimed 20mm cannons would remove a \"zero\" in less than 10 seconds even when the Japanese pilot was taking evasive maneuvers to make himself a target. The same with the Germans in Europe. The P-51 mustang was killed by few \"Zeros\" even at low level where it was most suited, with the best pilots the Japanese had (such as Saburo Sakai of 202), the Japanese pilots had some issues that reduced their effectiveness vs P-51s. They had to fly into the sun and even if they shot down the P-51 pilot, they often forgot to do the 180 degree turn, leaving themselves and their comrades sitting ducks.\nThe P-40 (which had been rushed into production long before being properly field-tested) simply didn't stand much chance against skilled A6M pilots during the early part of the Pacific War, and the Japanese found the.50 caliber armament ineffective at altitude and also inaccurate at long range and unreliable in general, the pilot was simply too far from the gun to aim effectively.\nThe Japanese only had a few hundred A6Ms in service in 1941 and almost all were in China where they had limited success. When they were in contact with American carriers, the Japanese found themselves hopelessly outmatched, and although a few Zeroes did shoot down aircraft, the vast majority were lost in combat through outmoded engines making aircraft vulnerable to newer fire control systems, a very lackluster performance at altitude compared to the P-51, and the \"zero\" was no longer able to dominate the sky as before. The P-51 was superior to the \"zero\" in almost every way. It was faster, had longer range, fired better guns, and it's fighter had greater fire control systems, a higher top speed and much greater maneuverability. The \"zero\" lacked an effective radar, and it's two engines made it difficult to land on the carrier.\nThe first \"zero\" variant which was actually able to contend with Spitfires was the A6M3. But the most important breakthrough in Japanese fighter design had come in November 1942 with the replacement of the Type 91 engine by the two-speed Hitachi Kinshi (1500 h", "label": 1, "id": 100969}

{"text": "Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result in the short run from the spill, and long run form the oil industry and its products. They fear this event to trigger global climate change and also to result in the destruction of other ecosystems on the planet.\nHowever, environmentalists have a very particular point of view when they analyze events as major as this one. There is nothing wrong with disagreeing. For example, I recently posted here that I do not believe environmentalists understand how our societies will recover from this crisis. But, then again, perhaps my post, \u201cDeepwater\u2019s impact on society \u2013 part 1000 \u2013 we are now an oil dependent society,\u201d would not have as many hits had I not put \u201cdeepwater\u201d in the title at the beginning.\nAnyway, the environmentalists do see a long term biodiversity loss that is going to result from this event. They worry about the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico and especially the oil spill\u2019s impact on the oil rigs. So, the environmentalists do have a point, but I believe that even this point is partially wrong as well.\nLet me elaborate the reasons why this is the case. When something catastrophic happens that can cause harm for a large proportion of the species of a local ecosystem and thus a local environment, it is usually considered a disaster of large magnitude. In this case, most environmentalists agree that the disaster has been caused precisely by the destruction of marine life, since that is what we know the most about. Since, even if that is true, we do not know that this will happen, I find the reasoning questionable. The fact is that what we have seen from the beginning has that potential but we do not know if it will happen.\nAnother reason that environmentalists may be concerned about the possibility that ecosystems that were once considered pristine and untouched by humans be invaded by other species is that what we now know as a pristine environment was once invaded but we cannot notice it since we did not know about that invader at the time. A classic example is the case on evolution of species, which has been invaded and disrupted by the homo sapiens, but the process was so gradual as to be imperceptible when people only made use of natural resources and did not begin to change and impact the ecosystem.\nThe fact of the matter is that we should always be concerned and make sure that this will be a disaster of global magnitude. However, there are no guarantees. There is plenty of room for debate. If I were an environmentalist, I would be concerned about species that are already endangered by the onslaught of global climate change, and in particular about the possibility of overpopulation destroying many species or at least affecting them to a point at which their disappearance takes centuries, as it did recently in China.\nWhen I was asked whether I think about the future of our planet and society, I said \u201cyes. \u201c The key point is whether there is something we can do about it. For example, when we have disasters such as the one we have now or a disaster such as the one that happened 20 years ago in Mexico. We think about how we can better equip ourselves to handle such events so that we can avoid them or minimize the damage and the negative impacts they cause. The key for all of us to better prepare ourselves for dealing with these disasters is through education. I consider myself a teacher of risk and risk management, and this is why I am writing here on this blog and have other initiatives. We can never really have an end in our efforts to make sure that we never have to suffer disasters of this magnitude. We can only try to make ourselves better prepared whenever a disaster can possibly happen.\nThis entry was posted on May 4, 2010 at 11:34 pm\tand is filed under Disasters, Economics, Education, Environmental, Risk Management.

The Rhine and its 331 tributary streams drain about 74,000 square kilometres (28,540 sq mi) of land. The river is a considerable navigable waterway of great economic and political importance. A total of 11 countries are lying along the banks of the Rhine.\nWhile the Rhine reaches out to sea, it never reaches its furthestmost outlet (for its length is never the same) at 1,240 km (770 mi) the distance has been measured at its maximum in Basel. Other towns at the Rhine include Bonn, Bad Godesberg, Koeln, Koblenz, Worms, Mainz, Speyer, Kehl, Bingen, Lahr, Sausheim, Bad S\u00e4ckingen, Schaffhausen, H\u00fcningen, and Basel.\nThe Rhine has a basin with an area of about 150,791 square kilometres (58,220 sq mi) and, including the area of its tributaries of the area up to 341,215 square kilometres (132,000 sq mi). It is bounded by the Vosges Mountains on the northeast, the Black Forest, the Upper Rhine Plain and the Jura Mountains to the south, the Swiss Alps and Lake Constance and the Northern Black Forest to the north. The Rhine's sources are the Thur, the Reuss, the Aar, the Birs, the Oberrhein and the Vorderrhein.\nIn the past, the Rhine was used as a transport route for wine, wood, mineral ore, and slaves. This usage has significantly declined in favor of shipping via the river's dams, such as those in Remagen, Koblenz and Bonn, that were built in the 20th century for economic purposes (still for exporting). Other reasons for economic purposes is to provide a water supply for large cities. Other dams are planned, but environmentalists want them to be built as weirs to preserve the river's ecology.\nThe Rhine flows mainly in a northerly direction with two notable exceptions. Between Bingen am Rhein and Bonn the river, instead of heading north, stretches in an easterly direction. Between Basel and Rotweil, the Rhine turns sharply to the south and forms the border between Switzerland and Germany. Near Basel the river and its tributary streams have cut through the Swiss Jura and the French Vosges.\nThere are about 2 million inhabitants living along the banks of the Rhine in Germany, of whom 2.6 % live in the central Rhine Valley (between the confluences of Ruhr and Neckar). About 8 million people live on the Rhine in Switzerland of whom 5.6 % live on the left shores. On the left riverbanks of France live 9.6 % of the 13.7 million people on the Rhine. In the western part of Germany about 57%, Switzerland about 64% and France about 80% of the population live on the banks of the Rhine.\nOn the upper Rhine the river flows between the Vosges mountains with their gorges, and the Rhenish Slate Mountains, with numerous gorges. The lower Rhine is bordered by the Lower Rhine Hills and the Dutch Plateau. In the middle and lower Rhine, the surrounding uplands rise in steep slopes.\nFurther information: List of tributaries of the River Rhine\nThe major tributaries of the Rhine include: the Rh\u00f4ne, the Main, Danube, Neckar, Warta and the Rego.

A number of special solutions is applied in all important cases of the problem. In practice, two problems associated with the inversion procedure of gravity surveys are most critical. The first of these problems is incurred in situations when the value of the true gravity anomaly is much less than unity; the second is typical when the value of the inversion error becomes as small as a fraction of the minimum error. It is noted that on one hand the first problem is predominant, and on the other hand the second problem is a rarity. The inversion error and inversion error error can thus be conveniently expressed in the ratio of a few numbers of the order of several million and the fraction of the minimum error; the inversion error is thus of the order of thousands of multiplied by 0.1. For the inversion process on the basis of a complete elliptic regularization, two numerical tests are given; the first one assumes that the actual distribution of the error is known so the results of the regularized inversion of the original data are compared with those of the regularized inversion of the processed data.

The existence of such a gauge invariant anyon system does not preclude the possibility of having a topological order and of implementing a quantum computation. Actually a non abelian topological order may consist of quasiparticles whose anyon charge does not commute with the gauge degrees of freedom \\cite{B2004}. Thus, in order to implement the operations mentioned above within the framework of topological quantum computation, it is necessary to distinguish the gauge phase degree of freedom from the rest of the Hilbert spaces.\n\nFortunately, this is possible in the fermionic and anyonic systems and we can use this distinction to implement a non-abelian topological state. A good example can be had from the fractional anyonic systems described in \\cite{Cirac2009}, where non-abelian topological states can be prepared from the fermionic models introduced in the same article.\n\nThe most significant differences between the gauge and the non-abelian topological phases are:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[1. The gauge connection]\nThe gauge connection which implements the gauge degrees of freedom becomes insensitive for non-abelian topological phases.\n\\item[2. The topological charge]\nThe non abelian topological phases are characterised by a non-abelian topological charge (NATC) defined as\n\\begin{equation}\nk_i= 4 \\int d^2 r N_i(r)^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_i$ denotes the holon operator of that anyonic species, see below. The integer $k_i$ is gauge invariant and, thus, measuring the NATC corresponds to unveiling the topological feature of the phase without involving gauge connections.\n\\item[3. Anyon statistics]\nIn anyonic phases with non-abelian topological charge $k_i$, the holons interact according to fermionic or bosonic statistics depending on the parity of $k_i$.\nFermionic theories are fully characterised by the statistics of the quasiparticles.\nBosonic theories may be also characterised by the statistics of the quasiparticles if these degrees of freedom are described by anyonic quasiparticles, in this case they are related by\n\\begin{equation}\nk_i= 4 \\int d^2 r S_{i,i}(r)^2 +2 \\int d^2 r {\\vec s_{i,i} (r) \\cdot \\vec s_{i,i} (r) }.\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{description}\nThe fermionic and bosonic theories on topological phases are characterised by different topological properties, but the same abelian topological charges.\n\nFor this reason, in the following discussion we will separate, as usual for bosons, the study of the non-abelian topological phases from fermions and abelian topological orders \\cite{Moore1991}.\n\n\\subsubsection{A unitary gauge transformation}\n\nLet us suppose that the system we want to evaluate the NATC over is described by the following Hamiltonian which includes a pair of gauge fields:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nH = H_0(G) + \\frac{H_1(G)}{2 \\pi},\n\\label{UnitaryGauge}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $H_1$ is the gauge field and $H_0$ denotes an on-site term. The Hamiltonian in eq. (\\ref{UnitaryGauge}) can also be considered as a gauge invariant Hamiltonian, since it is invariant with respect to any unitary transformation $U$, $H(U) = H(1)$, which is a symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to the gauge degrees of freedom. When we want to perform a measurement only on the gauge degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian in eq. (\\ref{", "label": 1, "id": 100975}

{"text": "CC Search beta has added 470,000 images from the millions it has for sale. These are the new images that are more on themes and are more focused. The site uses a new system called CC Search Selector that makes searching for images, video and audio a lot more focused.\nIf you go via the CC Search home page, there is the usual search box with the Advanced and Keyword Searches \u2013 there are 24 categories to choose from. Then, below are the various search pages.\nI selected \u201cArt\u201d and the Advanced Search and searched \u201cCinema and Theater\u201d\nI got 34 results which I could narrow down by keywords, the date (which seems unusual since the period is 0-19 years), the copyright status (free for reuse or not) and the collection. I chose Free For Non Commercial Use only and in my results box I got 9 results.\nI noticed that there was a button \u201cAdjust Image Size\u201d which will scale the image size to about 1/5th to 0.5 of the original image size.\nI selected \u201cArt\u201d again and chose Keyword Search. I added \u201ctheater\u201d and \u201cactresses\u201d and clicked Search. I am very interested and I am just starting to play with CC by this time.\nI did find the 3 images I wanted on the first page. The first one, I clicked the image name to go to the full page of details, and as I scrolled down, the image is of course, displayed in full size. Then on the right hand side, I clicked the green \u201cView as Free (reuse)\u201d and the page went to a full page of view and on the left had, I could select any size I wanted or select the Adjust Image Size button as I did earlier. The image I wanted was a headshot of actress Kathryn Leigh Scott and was 5350 X 2596 pixels in size, I clicked that and got the file with the dimensions of 2592 x 1392 pixels.\nI did it again and saved the image at a size of 1440 x 960 pixels and there are also other sizes (2560 x 1600 and 1024 x 768 pixels) that I can save as well. Here\u2019s the new size I selected \u2013 this way I can save the image size that I needed and there were more available.\nWhile on the CC Search selector page, I am searching for \u201ctheater\u201d\nAs you can see, there is a page of 23 results and I just clicked the keyword of theater, it took me to the page of results.\nI selected the image size \u2013 see the screen images for clarity\nI can also click anywhere on the search page and the selection of the image size will change.\nI also did a search for \u201cactress\u201d and this is the results page.\nClicking anywhere on the image of choice will show the CC Search Selector page.\nI did the same for the second result which is a picture of Jane Russell and William Holden.\nThen I tried a different category and my results were like this \u2013 which is the usual full page search. I tried out the same keyword search for \u201ctheater\u201d and got 3 results.\nThen for the other keyword search, I got a results page with 870 results.\nIf I hover my cursor on any particular search result, a tiny thumbnail will appear.\nWhat I liked with the CC Searching system is that it is easy to find particular images and video by doing a keyword search. Searching for video was much better than before because the size options are more focused and because of advanced search, you could find specific images in specific categories, such as the people or film festival type events. The quality also seems to have improved.\nCC Search is a great search engine because of its focus, the large database, and the fact that I do not have to go through a whole big and confusing list of millions of images. I can go right to a list of 24 categories and search within a certain group, even though the entire CC database is there; I just select a collection and then focus the search on just that. The Adjust Image Size was also a plus factor because although I liked the fact that the default size was a more manageable size I could easily select a size that was more manageable to my intended use of the image.\nI didn\u2019t test out the sound files because I feel that it is difficult, especially when you are using the Advanced Search, to tell exactly what you want by keyword search but I like that the new design looks more presentable. CC Search could have focused on certain collections instead of having several categories that show up in every search \u2013 my", "label": 1, "id": 100977}

Personally, I enjoyed it, because even though a lot has changed, most aspects like the use of a video camera, a walkie-talkie and a TV screen being used for important calls, remains the same.\nThe first part reminded me of \u2018War Games\u2019 where a group of kids hacked the US defense system. Some things like the video recording of the event, the voice calling on the phone when the main hero has to get up, and the use of a ham radio were the same in that movie.\nIt is a story that revolves around a bunch of 13-year-old school boys who get into trouble when they hack into the Pentagon computer systems by mistake. The boys manage to download a program which causes the world to believe that the US is under attack from Russia. The movie has the added element of the boys creating viruses to infect the school\u2019s system. That was quite a bit of info for kids to handle at that age. It was the first movie to show some of the dangers the Internet could create in the future. But the computer effects are not all that impressive nowadays.\nThe actors are all unknown. But they did a marvelous job. This is the story of some outcast kids who decide to write and direct a video for a school competition. They don\u2019t have any good ideas so they decide to take a movie clip to use in the video. They hack into the Pentagon\u2019s computer system and accidentally download the most powerful war game ever written. They start playing the game and find out that one of the games is the simulation of a real nuclear attack from Russian missiles headed straight for the United States. The computer\u2019s simulation says that the U. S. Defense systems are not ready, so they have 64 minutes to launch nuclear counter strikes or the country will be wiped out. This movie contains an unforgettable performance from Christian Slater. His character, Elmo, has just been released from reform school. He ends up becoming the leader of the group and they enlist the help of one of the school\u2019s most popular teachers, played by Bill Mumy. They are not all that interested when it comes to aiding the U. S. Government, but after hearing the news, they are forced to do what they can to help. There are some exciting scenes in the movie where the kids are shown struggling to create counter strikes, and all the while avoiding the government and all the authorities pursuing them. This is the first time most of the kids will see a real nuclear bomb go off before their eyes. A great sound track as well. The movie is a really good one, and if you haven\u2019t seen it already, I highly recommend it. Not to be confused with the movie called \u2018Deep Blue Sea\u2019.", "label": 1, "id": 100978}
{"text": "purpose of this study was to evaluate the lymphocyte populations of normal and diseased pigs to determine the differences between them, which may be caused by stress, diseases and aging.\nTwenty healthy pigs with a mean weight, backfat thickness and age of 90 11 days were raised in a natural environment in the farm. Three health diseased pigs with weight, backfat thickness and age of 255 25 days were raised in the experimental condition of the farm. Two groups of pigs were processed for immunohistochemistry and the results were compared with the pig immunohistochemistry protocol.\nThe results of this study showed a significant difference in the distribution of intracellular calcium (CIC) in the lymphocytes of both normal and diseased pigs with regard to time, weight, sex and disease. The expression of glucose transporters and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDE) in T and B lymphocytes were significantly different between the normal and diseased pigs with reference to age, which decreased in all cases. The study of lymphocyte subcom-ponent populations showed that all populations differed in normal pigs compared to diseased pigs. The differences in the number of gammadelta T-cells for age and weight in diseased compared to normal pigs were statistically significant (P 0.05) from normal pigs.\nThe authors propose that the lymphocytes act as an early warning system for internal changes and abnormalities, where the immune system increases activity to fight against stress, environment and diseases.\nA lymphocyte\u2019s ability to respond to stress is related to a normal cell\u2019s ability to adjust their cellular and molecular structures. This function is based on the activation of the nuclear and membrane components in the cell (Ala, 1996).\nStress may have different influences on the immune system and its function.\nThe most important ones are:\n- Inflammatory response activation: The production of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory factors.\n- Activation of immune cells and their role in lymphocytes: Activated lymphocytes produce inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and take up bacteria and antigens.\n- Lymphocyte migration to the site of injury and cell death: Lymphocytes migrate to the site of injury and inflammation, and under the stress of tissue injury and death, these cells increase their role in the site of tissue damage.\n- Change of the lymphocytes\u2019 function, for example increasing the activity of phagocytosis.\nStress is considered a major factor of disease and aggression in the pigs (Ramaswamy, 2002) and one of the most important risk factors in many viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, such as: BVD, MDBV, EIDV, PRRS, porcine parvovirus (PPV) PED, porcine enteric diarrhea (PED), swine influenza, influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, PRRS, enteric coronavirus (enteroCV), coronavirus PC, coronavirus in pigs PCV, corona virus in swine PCV, porcine corona virus (PCV).\nIn addition to stress, aging of pigs has been shown as a cause of the development or severity of diseases, which includes the effects of inflammatory response activation, activation of immune cells and changes in lymphocyte sub-populations. The authors studied the immune system of pigs and evaluated the lymphocyte population to explain the mechanisms that occur during stress and aging.\n- Study the immune system of pigs by evaluation immune systems.\n- Study the lymphocyte subpopulations in normal and diseased pigs at different ages.\n- Study the activity of glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) and immune cells as indicators of stress in normal and diseased pigs.\n- Study the distribution of intracellular calcium (CIC) in lymphocytes in normal and diseased pigs at different ages.\n- Evaluation of the distribution of glucose transporters (GLUT) in lymphocytes of normal and diseased pigs at different ages\n- 10 000 p", "label": 1, "id": 100979}

Most of that 5.8-percent increase in the Hispanic-origin population was due to higher birth rates among Hispanic women, not to the higher level of immigrations noted earlier. As of June 30, 1990, there were 6.0 million persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin living in the United States who were either born in Spain, Portugal, or Latin America and were not necessarily of Hispanic origin 25 or of Spanish culture. Those persons of Hispanic origin who were born in Central or South America are almost entirely of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin.\nLANGUAGE USAGE AMONG POPULATIONS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN\nThe terms Hispanic, Spanish, and Latin are often used interchangeably; however, linguists and other scholars consider the definitions for Hispanic and Latin languages to be somewhat broader. Latin as a linguistic and cultural designation is used to refer to those who lived in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and their overseas empire in earlier centuries, as well as other Latin American populations. The number of Latin-speaking persons in the United States doubled in the past three decades, increasing from 0.9 million in the 1960 decennial census to 2.3 million in 1990 (table 3). In the latter year, Spanish was used at home by approximately 31.1 million persons, or 34.7 percent of all U.S. residents.3 Of those who spoke Spanish at Home, 73.4 percent were Hispanic and 9.7 percent were non-Hispanic white, the fastest growing minority groups in the nation. The Hispanic-origin population of the country had doubled during the 1980s. By the end of 1989, the Hispanic population was more than 36 times its size in 1920.\nThe proportion of Spanish-speakers in the United States increased from 17.4 percent in 1960 to 17.8 percent in 1970, fell slightly to 17.6 percent in 1980 and 1980, and then rose again to 18.3 percent in 1990. In 1980, the total number of foreign Spanish speakers was 16.6 million, while the number speaking English at home was 241.7 million. At home, 51.1 million lived among 18 million non-Hispanics. Among Spanish-speakers, about one-half were bilingual,2 and in most cases they spoke primarily Spanish at home, while speaking English at work, school, and elsewhere. Those who spoke English predominantly at home numbered 14.8 million, more than twice as many as those who spoke Spanish only at home. In 1990, Puerto Ricans, who accounted for 79.5 percent of Americans of Spanish speaking ancestry, had higher median incomes than most foreign-born and domestic speaking groups, and their unemployment rate was less than that of foreign-born, native (including native-born native), and all speaking groups. A Puerto Rican family was also more likely than all Spanish-language groups other than native-born native Spanish speakers to possess a home and automobile.\nIn 1990, 24.4 million American residents used Spanish to share a portion of daily activities. In most instances, they combined Spanish-language usage with English, which made them bilingual. About 40.3 percent of those aged 5 and older used only Spanish at home, while only 8.1 percent primarily used English to communicate with their family. The largest Spanish-speaking group was Mexicans, at 35.1 percent. More speakers of Mexican ancestry lived in the United States than of any other national-ancestry group, and with the exception of the United States in California and Texas, the highest population density was found in New York. The second largest group, Puerto Ricans, accounted for 22.1 percent of all Americans of Spanish speaking ancestry, but only 5.9 percent of the Hispanic population. Although Puerto Ricans lived in more than one-half of the states, the majority still lived in New York or New Jersey.\n", "label": 1, "id": 100984}

So why is he still in prison?\nIn 1983, Colin Pitchfork was tried and convicted for the rape and murder of 15-year-old schoolgirl Samantha Knight, whose body was found in a field near Leicester in 1983. He was sentenced to two life terms. He denied the accusation of murder. And while today, his guilt is beyond doubt, he remains in prison. And still refuses to admit what he did. Why?\nColin Pitchfork has served more time than any other man imprisoned in Britain for rape, the only one to have been convicted twice for rape. He was convicted on the basis of a confession to Samantha\u2019s murder and a DNA test \u2013 in 1988 and 1991 \u2013 that connected him to her body, but he maintains that he was beaten in order to get him to sign the confession and he is convinced his DNA is a fraud.\nThe first confession made no sense: Pitchfork said he had been picked up by a couple driving near his home, and sexually abused, before being taken to the field. The woman in the car had a cut above her eyebrow, an exact replica of the cut left on Samantha Knight\u2019s forehead. He claimed it was a bite, but later admitted \u201che bit her\u201d.\nHe was sentenced to two life sentences for murder at Nottingham Crown Court in 1988. His sentence was later reduced to 35 years on appeal, but on 17 December 1991 he walked free from court. When he left custody, the police found no evidence that he was a danger to the public.\nSamantha\u2019s mother, Linda, fought long and hard to overturn Pitchfork\u2019s conviction. In 1998 DNA testing showed that his DNA profile did not match with the semen and blood found at the scene of the crime: he was given a discretionary life term but refused to admit to the crime. In 2005 he was given a whole-life jail term.

In the days that followed, the Police hunted for Samantha but there was no sign of her.\nSamantha\u2019s family searched for her at her friend\u2019s home before going to Samantha\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house to look for her with his parents.

It was a chance to see one of the most unique filmmakers of the 20th century make another film, to see what kind of performance his \u201clost boy\u201d character gave and what kind of contribution he made to the final product. (Of course, this film was shot after a starring role in Macbeth on Broadway and before Citizen Kane.)\nWelles was definitely at his best here, portraying a character far more sympathetic than most of his other roles and acting on-par with many Hollywood movie stars of the time. He\u2019s the lost boy, and all Welles has to do is act and look good. Other parts are filled by a bunch of big-name actors of the day who give serviceable performances, but it\u2019s Welles who holds the film together \u2014 and it can be forgiven any weaknesses in the film as a whole. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but the film definitely had more appeal than any \u201cadventure tale\u201d I\u2019ve seen before and probably a lot more historical accuracy than you\u2019ll find in your average Disney fairytale. There\u2019s also a bit of humor in the dialogue and action, though it\u2019s more obvious at first than by the time Welles is introduced (or, rather, not).\nIf you\u2019re expecting anything other than \u201cswashbuckling fun adventure\u201d, this may disappoint you a little.

One wants to make films which do not distort life, but, at the same time, one also wants films which help us to live. We accept a film and say it is a beautiful film, while in fact it is a lie (as many lies as its merits), but it was a lie the camera was able to tell. One\u2019s art is never a mirror; it is a more interesting thing, it is a sort of lie; it is a half-truth, so, you can\u2019t just take it as a matter of fact.\u201d\nThat is from the introduction to the 1978 book interview compilation Kubrick on Film. It explains exactly the attitude most cinematic storytellers have, the paradox between the truth of cinema (everything in the picture \u201cis shown\u201d) and the interpretation and embellishment that make a given film art. This book is an outstanding exploration of the cinematic craft \u2014 it collects interviews from 1968 through 1987, giving Kubrick\u2019s views throughout a variety of films. And it\u2019s a book that has been on my shelf for more than 20 years, and just recently became a priority for me; after nearly a decade of writing my own fiction, it was only natural that I should want to read Kubrick\u2019s words on storytelling.\nKubrick\u2019s style of storytelling is distinctive, to say the least. His stories \u2014 or rather, the stories he adapts and creates (or, rather, co-creates) \u2014 often begin without any idea as to what\u2019s going to happen. Like so many screenwriters, he begins with a character and has that character do something; the situation, theme, and story come later. This often results in a narrative feeling incomplete, the events taking place one after another with no apparent logic in the storytelling.\nStylistically, his films are also notable in that they \u201cspeak\u201d very little dialogue; characters \u201cspeak\u201d with their actions and dialogue is more a device to", "label": 1, "id": 100986}

This allows us to define a conditional mutual information as the vonNeumann relative entropy for this probability P[a|b]. In general, a Bell inequality can be defined as the maximum of the vonNeumann relative entropy between two subsystems. Since b and a are non-local variables, this definition of Bell\u2019s inequality is impossible. However, it's possible with the Bennett causal formalism (2003).\nThe Bell inequalities which are derived from this formalism are Bell's inequalities because the conditional mutual informations that are used as variables in the inequality are conditional to local variables, which can be measured in experiment.\nOne possible scenario could be that of a toy experiment where the experimentalists would...\nOne possible scenario could be that of a toy experiment where the experimenter observes the following local variables:\nAlice: A and Z\nBob: B and Z\nAlice and Bob could choose to measure their variable of choice at time t=0 or t=1, in order to minimize the conditional vonNeumann relative entropy. If Alice chose to measure her variable of choice at time (t=0) and Bob chose to measure his variable of choice one unit of time later, this would violate Bell's inequality. This is because, if it wasn't done with the goal of minimizing the conditional vonNeumann relative entropy, there would have been an event within this two unit time interval which was correlated with the choice of Alice and Bob. However, as the choice of the event and the choice of Alice and Bob are random, we can state that they are uncorrelated, which requires the violation of Bell's inequality.\nThis is the same principle as that of the toy experiment in which the experimenter is free to decide whether to change Z between the measurement of Alice and the measurement of Bob.\nThis toy experiment is equivalent to the one in which the experimenter has the freedom to decide whether to observe Z, and is equivalent to the toy experiment of having conditional mutua l information.\nLet's call the former the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\" and the toy...\nLet's call the former the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", and the latter \"the conditional mutual information\"\nSo, the first important aspect is that in the \"choice of time interval\" the time interval is not random. This is because the experimenter can choose to observe Z at either time interval, so it's actually the choice that is not random.\nNow, let's call that \"the random choice of time\"\nThe second important concept is that there is a causal order between the conditioning variables in the case of \"the choice of time interval\" and between the local variables in the case of \"the conditional mutual information\".\nThe causal order between the conditioning variables in \"the choice of time interval\" has a certain temporal order which is not the same as the temporal order of the conditional mutual information.\nLet me try to explain this.\nIn the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", there will be a sequence of local variables A,...\nIn the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", there will be a sequence of local variables A, Z and B.\nThe conditioning variables associated with this toy experiment are Z, since it's the event that is associated with the variable that is being randomly chosen, and A, because it's at the very beginning; it's the first choice that one makes when beginning a choice. The events associated with Z in the \"choice of time interval\" have a chronologic order.\nIn the toy experiment with the causal inference \"the conditional mutual information\", however,...the causal order of the conditioning variables is different.\nIn the conditional mutual information, we have a sequence of conditional mutual information variables: A, Z, and B.

{"text": "Mitt Romney is all about dismantling the federal government's role in people's lives, and would slash funds for education, health, infrastructure and virtually all other federal government services. This includes drastic cuts to Medicaid, which funds home health care for many older and disabled Americans, and, in many cities, the only thing that keeps children fed and housed.\nMitt Romney's policies would make us poorer.\nWorse yet, his tax plan would turn the country into a massive Ponzi scheme that would make us all richer, just for a while.\nMitt Romney's policies would make everyone poorer.\nBecause the cost of his tax cuts can't be borne by the rich - they wouldn't have enough money to pay it all, after all - he'd have to raise taxes sharply on everyone. Either that, or slash spending so drastically that essential services would crumble. But he won't do that. That would hurt the rich, too.\nBecause Mitt Romney's tax plan cuts the taxes of the top 1 percent by about $200,000 a year, and the taxes of the top 0.1 percent by closer to $1 million, the people that need and deserve those tax breaks so much are the ones who would receive them.\nInstead, middle-class tax cuts would be revenue-neutral, meaning Mitt Romney would raise taxes on everyone else to pay for the breaks for the rich.\nBut that's precisely what's wrong. That's not a tax cut. It's a transfer.\nMiddle and lower-income people pay more in taxes. They get less. Upper-income people pay the same, the tax rates on their income-tax returns, but they get a lot more money.\nHere's how it works. Under the Romney plan, 75 percent of Americans' tax returns get a tax increase. A tax increase. But Mitt Romney's plan doesn't get rid of tax loopholes. It keeps them.\nSo if you're thinking, \"But what if Congress were to follow through and actually do something about special deals that only apply to the big 1 percent of the super-rich?\" Well, that's not going happen. Not in today's bitter fight where everything has to be passed with a 60-vote, filibuster-proof Senate (Romney is on record as opposing even a modest increase to the minimum tax for the 50,000 people in America who have an income over $1 million but less than a million, which, as you might suspect, mostly aren't Mitt Romney).\nSo, no. Tax increases for 75 percent of American taxpayers won't happen. But there's a whole lot of extra money for Mitt Romney in your paycheck or tax refund.\nBut what about the economy? That's where Mitt Romney would really hurt all of us.\nWe've got it all pretty good now, but he'd slash government spending so much, economist Jason Furman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates in a study of the plan's macroeconomic effects, it would cause a 6.8 million job loss.\nThat's a lot. That's almost 10 percent of all the wage and salary income in the country. So it's a big job. (And, as a reminder, President Obama's plan would create jobs. All of 'em.)\nHe'd reduce the size of government in half.\nBut as economist Romer said, \"If (Mitt Romney) didn't care about helping people and just decided to do it to balance the federal budget, it does become a tax cut for everybody.\"\nYes. A tax increase and job losses would balance the federal budget, if you're rich, by cutting spending on you.\nBut Mitt Romney would reduce the size of the federal government by about half.\nI know some liberals might think that's a good thing.\nThe problem with that math: The federal government spends your money more productively than you do. It's not what Mitt Romney's people say, it's an established principle of economics, called \"market failure.\" You don't spend your money in your self-interest, you spend money for yourself that may also benefit others.\nFor example, if the federal government didn't exist, there'd be no National Weather Service, and you might find it cheaper to pay for food rather than pay for air pollution control.", "label": 1, "id": 100989}
{"text": "Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node in which the connection is agreed upon in the network. To establish a connection between an initiating node and the responding node, a handshaking protocol is employed: a message is transmitted by the initiating node to the responding node to request the connection. The responding node then checks if it is within range of the initiating node, and if it is, will either accept or reject the request. The connection is then initialized, which involves the exchange of connection establishment and releasing headers during the connection lifetime. The protocol for the exchange of connection establishment and releasing headers is specified by ITU-T [10].\nTo make the channel in the transmission a virtual channel, the packetization layer of the network encapsulates the transmitted data into IP packets. Because the connection itself is already defined in the network, the packet headers are only concerned with the transport layer protocol of the upper layer. The transport layer (in this case UDP) is responsible for the segmentation, reordering, and fragmentation of the packets. Apart from that it is responsible for the error detection and correction, and the flow and congestion control in the network.\nThe transport layer establishes the connection at the application level. The connection is a logical connection consisting of two endpoints, the initiating point and the responding point. The connection endpoints are not necessarily on a physical common network. To transfer the data packets between the endpoints, a network address in the upper layer protocols (Layer 4) must be attached to each packet.\nWhen a packet reaches the destination end of the connection, the upper layer protocol will unpack the header and check whether this is the correct packet. If the packet is correctly received and verified, the application level will check if the data payload has arrived correctly. If this is correct, the packet will be reassembled and handled by the upper layer protocol. If the data payload is not correctly received or in any way corrupted, it will be resent. This is because a packet has always reliable end-to-end delivery, regardless of the type of transmission media the packet uses. This property of transmission is called the principle of end-to-end delivery. To improve reliability, it is recommended practice to employ error control techniques such as cyclic redundancy checking[6].\nFigure 3 Network Architecture: the connection is between two nodes in a network\nApplication layer, Application layer, Application layer, The connection is end-to-end transparent, which is, to the upper layer protocols.\nFor UDP service, the sender does not need to guarantee that a whole application data frame reaches its destination. UDP transport layer protocols provide an additional option, namely the window service, which can reduce the number of re-transmissions. This option is optional and may be implemented only if the application has chosen to implement it.\nThe UDP does not make a distinction between the data transfer and the control transfer of its transport layer protocols. By default, whenever the host in UDP sends a packet, it cannot distinguish whether this involves the actual data transmission to be controlled or part of the data transmission to be controlled. That is, it is possible for every time UDP to send a sequence of packets to the server. This may result in packets that only control and not the data to be transmitted. This function allows the transmission of UDP packet data to be controlled in a timely manner using only a single UDP packet.\nIf it is required to perform a transmission of data data, a single UDP packet can be sent by a UDP host. The server expects UDP to receive 1 byte of data, for example 100 characters. If less data is received, the server can send the remaining number of characters to be transmitted. However, the host does not know this. Since each piece of data is an unrelated UDP packet, which the host itself created, the server may not know exactly what data the client expects, and how many bytes of data it would like to send. This causes the problem mentioned in the introduction that there should be an error in the transmission to be able to resend data after a timeout.\nThe data packet to be transmitted must have a number in the UDP header for data segment number (Data-seq number). This value represents the number of bytes of the current package. With this information, the host can request the server to send the missing bytes of the data. For example, if 100 characters are to be transmitted, the client should send the UDP header data sequence 0 1. The host does not send the characters it receives, but with this number of bytes to be received, the server sends 100 bytes of data to the client. As a result the UDP client receives 200", "label": 1, "id": 100990}

{"text": "background : during off - pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery a patient is required to maintain supine position throughout the procedure. Sternal retractor is used to keep the sternum immobilized and elevated during the surgery. The primary object of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different types and brands of sternal retractors over others. Materials and Methods: In this randomized, double - blind study 120 adult patients undergoing OPCAB by a senior cardiac surgeon, having a body mass index less than 30 were included. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups-the Sternal Retractor and the Standard Inferior Retractor group. Patient saturation as obtained from oxygen saturation probe, time taken from admission to induction of anesthesia, time taken till sternotomy, procedure time, total duration of stay of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and incidence of sternal wound infection were noted at weekly intervals for a period of eight weeks. Results: In this study group, there were 60 patients in each group. The sternal retractions were comparable in both the groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of stay in the ICU (P < 0.05). The duration of stay of patients in our study was considerably less than the average hospital stay in patients after OPCAB. The retractors had a definite effect on duration of stay in ICU and hospital cost. Conclusions: We conclude that use of lightweight aluminum sternal retractor has a definite effect in reducing intensive care stay in OPCAB patients.\nPatent ductus arteriosus is a heart ailment encountered in premature infants. It arises since the ductus arteriosus that passes blood from the pulmonary to the aorta prior to birth is still open as compared to adults in whom this has closed. In 1952, Cools introduced trans-catheter approach to deal with this condition in premature infants; but the mortality was huge. Hence trans-umbilical approach in treating patent ductus arteriosus in neonates started with the introduction of umbilical cannula by Mays in the year 1984. Herein, we report the case of a girl child presented in term with respiratory distress secondary to patent ductus arteriosus. She was managed with trans-umbilical patent ductus arteriosus closure without any major complication.\nIntroduction: The term 'Aneurysm' was first used by Oswaldo Cruz to denote large dilatation of human aorta without vessel wall breach. Diseases affecting the abdominal aorta are relatively uncommon. Early diagnosis and immediate treatment are often beneficial. Material and Method: This retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Kerala which includes the patients who have undergone surgical exploration and/or therapeutic option from January 2008\u2013December 2009. Results: Four patients accounted for the overall incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) as a cause of clinical presentation. Mean age was 62 years. One had atherosclerotic disease, three others presented with chronic abdominal pain and a ruptured pouch-anterior wall aneurysm. Two patients had surgical aneurysmal excision and the remaining three had repair. Conclusion: The aim of this study was to review the experience and the management outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysms in our institution over a period of two years. This may help us formulate a surgical management algorithm for the abdominal aortic aneurysms.\nBackground and Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of arthroscopy and microdissection on the outcome of reconstructive surgery of the hip in cases of avascular necrosis of femoral head (AVNFH) complicated with avascular and dysvascular femoral head and early diagnosis of AVNFH with ultrasonography and radiography.

Screening mammography has significantly reduced deaths due to breast cancer in white women; however, the impact of such mammography screening has not been well studied and investigated in women of other races. A recent study reported that black women have lower breast cancer mortality compared to white women at all ages after controlling for age, stage at diagnosis, hormone receptor status, and other confounders. This study also found lower mortality for black women in the youngest age group (ages 15 to 49), which raises the question of why screening mammography, which is of no benefit for women before they reach the age of 40 years, can have such an effect on racial and ethnic differences in breast cancer mortality. the author's team reviewed the literature on factors that influence breast cancer mortality in 25 countries, with special emphasis on the impact of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality by race and ethnicity. the factors reviewed are those expected to have an impact on breast cancer mortality through diagnosis and treatment (eg, breast cancer stage; incidence of breast cancer and stage at diagnosis; early relapse after diagnosis; and receipt of treatment). all studies considered, including those with mortality data from multiple sites, included only deaths due to breast cancer. this meta-analysis of 11,055 incident breast cancer cases provides further evidence, as well as some novel findings, that confirm that breast cancer screening can have a major impact on breast cancer mortality.\n(2010) The association between breast and cardiovascular disease risk factors: A meta-analysis of prospective studies.

{"text": "a 60-year male was admitted with advanced renal failure and was put on treatment. Two months later, while being treated in hospital the patient committed suicide.\na 61-year male patient underwent a successful cadaveric renal transplant on 21-08-1982. Post renal transplant, no treatment or medication were prescribed. Patient started having renal problems and was admitted to hospital on 08-01-1984. The patient was diagnosed to have acute rejection of graft and was treated with various modes of treatment, including corticosteroids. However, due to adverse effects of corticosteroids, the dose was slowly reduced. However, since no improvement in the condition was observed, the patient was again diagnosed with graft rejection and corticosteroids were given in the dose of 100 mg (oral)/ four times, which were gradually reduced. The patient remained in hospital for four months, during which time he developed various signs and symptoms of atherosclerosis. The patient was later treated with coronary artery bypass surgery, which was reportedly successful. Later, since the patient developed further cardiac problems and was not improving, he was admitted to hospital on 26-05-1987. He remained in the hospital for a week and expired on 30-05-1987. After preliminary analysis, he was reportedly diagnosed to have acute rejection of graft. As a part of the investigation, the patient\u2019s family was interviewed.\nWhen the patient was admitted to the hospital in 1984, since the patient was asymptomatic, the patient\u2019s family was not aware of any history suggestive of acute rejection of graft. However, the patient was undergoing relapse of disease and was on treatment at that point of time for graft rejection.\nIn 1987 also, when the patient reportedly died, the patient\u2019s family denied any history suggestive of rejection. However, reanalysis of records showed that during admission in 1984, a diagnosis of rejection of graft had been recorded and on the basis of which corticosteroid treatment along with other medication was given.\nAtherosclerosis is considered to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the cardiac patients. Atherosclerosis as a cause of death in a patient after renal transplantation would be explained by the following: (i) the kidneys get injured by the deposit of lipids in the circulation. This subsequently leads to damage in the renal vessels due to which the organ loses its function.\nKidneys get injured by the atherosclerotic process in the arterial blood and arterial anaemia becomes more prominent than usual, leading to compromise in organ perfusion. This results in ischaemia ultimately causing injury leading to tissue necrosis.\nKidney injury due to atherosclerosis cannot be explained by immunosuppression as post-transplant atherosclerosis is a common occurrence, and has been considered even in kidney transplanted from a living kidney donor and not from a deceased donor. Atherosclerosis may worsen the situation in transplant patients and predispose them to early death. It may explain the findings in this case report. The fact that the patient had no cardiac complaints during this latest hospitalisation probably reflects an important aspect which should be recognized in postrenal transplant patients \u2013 the high prevalence of silent atherosclerosis in this group of patients, which is one of the most common reasons reported for deaths in these individuals.\nSince there were no clinical findings to suggest the same, atherosclerosis had to be assumed as the cause of death. This was further supported by finding of calcium in the coronary arteries on autopsy but not on postmortem examination, findings of which were not present in the case of rejection of graft.\nAtherosclerosis is a multifactorial process involving endothelial dysfunction and immunological, genetic, environmental and thrombogenic factors. The disease is a frequent finding not only in patients with renal transplantation, but also in other patients with anatomical abnormalities of the coronary arteries. Atherosclerosis is a common finding in post-transplant patients and may be a frequent and insidious cause of heart disease in transplant recipients. When", "label": 1, "id": 100999}

{"text": "Feel like you're going through a bit of NFL withdrawal? That's no surprise -- the draft is over and summer training camps haven't begun yet. Fortunately, we have just the thing to tide you over: a new edition of the Uni Watch NFL Power Rankings, where we rank all of the NFL uniform sets, from first to worst.Before we get started, here's a refresher course on the Power Rankings ground rules:\u2022 All judging has been done by the Uni Watch Power Rankings Executive Committee, which has a membership of one and freely admits its biases. The committee is rather fond of striped socks, for example, but is less enthusiastic about monochromatic uniforms (solid-red, solid-black, and so on) and takes a dim view of design \"innovations\" that just feel like gimmicks. If you don't share the committee's preferences, then you're totally hopeless and it's a wonder you can dress yourself each morning that's fine -- the whole point of a project like this one is that it's fun to argue and disagree.\u2022 Each team has been ranked mainly on the basis of its primary colored and white uniforms, with alternate and throwback uniforms taken into account if they're part of the team's regular uni rotation. Consideration has been weighted to reflect how often a particular uniform combination is worn. The Cowboys, for example, hardly ever wear their blue jersey, so that design doesn't count very much in the team's ranking.\u2022 Certain rankings here are, by necessity, somewhat speculative. The Browns' new uniform set, for example, hasn't yet appeared on the field, so we can only go by how the unis looked at the team's unveiling event. Ditto for the 49ers' new black alternate design. In addition, at least two teams -- the Packers and Dolphins -- will have new throwback uniforms for 2015 that haven't yet been released.\u2022 For each team listed, you can click on the link below the team's name to see its current uniform set. The number in parenthesis after the team's name (\"+2,\" \"-3,\" etc.) indicates the team's movement up or down on the chart since the previous edition of the Power Rankings.OK, enough preliminaries -- let's get at it.1. Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)View uniforms hereAside from the switch from block numbers to italics (which many fans still gripe about, although it's been nearly 20 years now and we should all just get over it already), the Steelers have stayed the course.

{"text": "The members of the unit, Kompani Linge, honed their skills in fighting and sabotage at Glenmore, near Aviemore, before a clandestine mission in 1943. The commandos attacked a heavy water plant at Rjukan in Telemark, in southern Norway. Germany was using heavy water to control nuclear fission. Erling Lorentzen, one of the last survivors of Kompani Linge, is to be among a Norwegian delegation due to visit Glenmore Visitor Centre later on Friday, Armistice Day. There is a memorial to the Norwegian unit at the centre, and an event marking the 70th anniversary of the attack at Rjukan was held at the monument in 2013. Brian Duff, of Forest Enterprise Scotland, which manages the Glenmore forest estate, said the latest commemoration will have added poignancy. He said: \"As the years go by there are fewer of these men left to mark the exceptional acts that were carried out by the Norwegian commandoes. \"There were many missions behind enemy lines but none more important than that which prevented the Nazi completion of the atomic bomb. \"We have had the honour of welcoming veterans here before but this year we are very privileged to join Mr Lorentzen for a very poignant Armistice Day commemoration at Glenmore.\" Others expected in the Norwegian delegation include special forces soldiers, Norwegian Consulate General, Mona R??hne, Deputy Chief of Norwegian Special Operations Executive Command Eirik Kistoffersen and retired major general Johan Brun. The delegation is to later travel to London for a commemorative event at the Special Forces Monument near Lambeth Palace. In WW2, along with other places in Scotland including Dumfries in the south of Scotland, Glenmore provided a base for Norwegian servicemen and women, who had escaped from occupied Norway. A lodge at Glenmore in the Cairngorms was run by Britain's Special Operations Executive and known as Special Training School SPS26. The Norwegian commandos stationed there trained for one of the most daring missions of WW2. Before the war, heavy water formed as a by-product in production of nitrogen fertiliser. But its properties fascinated scientists. The heavy water plant at Rjukan was the only site in Europe producing large volumes of heavy water. It fell under German control in the the occupation of Norway. After training at Glenmore, the men of Kompani Linge parachuted into Norway and then endured hard winter conditions while hiding on a high winter plateau before mounting their assault on the plant at Rjukan. The commandos used explosives to damage the facility and destroy batches of heavy water. The plant was rebuilt before being completely devastated by US bombers later in the war. Members of the Kompani Linge also destroyed surviving barrels of heavy water loaded on to a ferry, which they sank. The commandos' Rjukan attack inspired the 1965 film The Heroes of Telemark starring Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris and Ulla Jacobsson. It was also recalled in the 2015 television mini series, The Saboteurs, also known as The Heavy Water War, which was broadcast in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and, in UK, by Channel 4. Other parts of Scotland also have close ties to Norway due to WW2. Stately home Carbisdale Castle, in Sutherland north of Glenmore, was used as a refuge for the Norwegian royal family, while the Shetland Bus was the name given to boats that ferried resistance fighters and refugees between Norway and the Northern Isles. Each year, Dumfries marks its war-time relationship with Norway. The town and the surrounding area provided sanctuary for Norwegian armed forces personnel. About 300 Norwegians arrived in Scotland in June 1940, landing in Hamilton before they were subsequently directed to Dumfries. They received military training in the town and the Norwegian army command later moved there. By 1941, their numbers had reached 1,000 and work got under way building a barracks at Carronbridge, north of Dumfries. ", "label": 0, "id": 101013}

{"text": "Hey Hexers, Cyriius here!Today we're not going in-depth into one deck like my previous articles but instead we'll take a look at a few competitive options for players interested in entering the Hex constructed world in a cheap way.I will offer a few budget decks from under 10$ to 20$ which will allow you to perform in the upcoming ladder. Technically you can obtain these without spending a single cent (with some PvE grinding) or just for a few bucks if you want to speed the process up. In addition to that I've added some important upgrades that you could purchase in order to perform even better. Those additions are by no means mandatory but could give you a little push to realize the dreamy climb to Cosmic Rank. These upgraded lists are able to win against any decks and have proven that through results.I will also share my thoughts on how difficult it is to play those decks \u2013 as that might be a factor impacting your choice on which deck to invest in. The decks will be given a difficulty rating from 1 to 5 stars \u2013 with 1 star being easy to 5 being extremely hard to play. To be clear those decks once piloted in skilled fashion are all able to get you easily to Cosmic Rank!Training/experience is key and not giving up after some losses is also important. Biggest advice I can give is instead of complaining about loss, to use it as a learning opportunity and analyze what happened because there's a good chance you could have played more optimally. This is especially true at the beginning of your learning curve and please don't forget that the decks, while being cheap, are actually hard to pilot.General Tips For Playing AggroSince most decks on this list are aggro, some general tips for playing this playstyle will probably be useful for those taking their first steps into constructed.-Be sure to attack the most efficient way possible, especially once you are playing high ranked opposition. People will tend to play more and more around your pump actions which means it will be harder for you to play them effectively, but note that this also allow you to bluff a little. Through experience, you will get a better sense of how to act in these critical situations.-When one of your troops is blocked by a Lifedrain troop, there are times when killing your own troop with a burn/kill can be beneficial to prevent your opponent from gaining life. Calculating all the possibilities in your head is of upmost importance when a single point of damage can be the difference between a win and a loss.-Overall sequencing Burn/Pump/Prophecy/Hero power the right way is key for those decks to be successful!-Last advice that is especially relevant for the aggro player: take your time while playing! Even if you take a lot of time during your first few turns that's okay because it is exactly where the biggest decisions are taken.R/S Morgan McBombusLet's jump into it with the most popular and the one", "label": 0, "id": 101023}
{"text": "Officials said most of the immigrants originally came from Haiti but others had come from as far afield as Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria. They said about 1,700 illegal migrants had arrived during the past two weeks. Acre, in the Amazon region, has asked for additional funding from the federal government to cope with the influx. More than 5,000 Haitians have arrived in Acre since 2010, but in recent months there has been an increase in immigration from Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh. Officials say the routes through Peru and Bolivia have become popular with people smugglers because dense vegetation makes it difficult for border police to patrol them. Dangerous odyssey Most of those who get caught are housed in a temporary shelter in the town of Brasileia, 280km (173 miles) south-west of the state capital Rio Branco. By Fabio PontesBBC Brasil The immigrants are housed in the former headquarters of a football club - it is a big warehouse-style building, where temperatures get extremely high. The average temperature during this season in Acre is around 35 degrees. Inside, it rises to more than 40 degrees. It can shelter up to 200 people but there are now more than 1,000; some have been relocated to tents outside. Others are sleeping rough in public spaces using their suitcases as beds and pillows. Because there are not enough public toilets, some of them are having to relieve themselves in the woods. The situation is truly chaotic. It is estimated that 10% of Brasileia's 20,000-strong population are immigrants who arrived within the last two years. Many of them are Haitians who fled their country after the 2010 earthquake, which left much of Haiti devastated. Resident Eli Lima de Freita told BBC Brasil that the town was in a state of \"absolute chaos'' as the authorities struggle to house and feed the immigrants. State authorities say dealing with the unexpected wave of illegal immigration has cost them about $1.5m (\u00c2\u00a31m) over the past two years. Haitian immigrants described flying from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, to Panama, then to Ecuador, from where they journeyed on by land to either Peru or Bolivia. From there they crossed into Acre, often paying \"coyotes\" or people smugglers to get them across the border. The Senegalese said they had travelled north from Senegal to Morocco, crossing over to Spain, from where they flew to Ecuador. From there, they continued along the same route taken by the Haitians. For many, Acre is not the final destination. They said they were trying to reach big urban centres in Brazil, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but would stay wherever they could make a living. Brazilian police last year raided a number of sweatshops in the capital, Brasilia, and in Sao Paulo, where undocumented immigrants from Bolivia and Pakistan were found working in unsafe conditions for very little or no pay.

{"text": "The Typhoons and six Polish jets will take over from a US squadron to patrol the alliance's eastern flanks. The long-standing rotation of Nato military jets in Lithuania has recently been stepped up in response to rising tensions with Russia over Ukraine. The UK government said the move would provide reassurance to Nato allies. The Typhoons will leave their base at RAF Coningsby on Monday morning and be joined by more than 100 RAF support staff in Lithuania. Only last week Typhoons based at RAF Leuchars in Fife intercepted two Russian bombers flying in international airspace off Scotland. The jets were sent to investigate the Russian planes which are understood to have turned away shortly afterwards. The MoD said fighter planes were scrambled to similar incidents eight times last year. The Typhoons' role over the Baltic states, which rely on Nato for fast jet support, will be similar. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the RAF fighters would provide reassurance to Nato allies at a time of heightened concern about Russia whose jets, the Pentagon has said, have already encroached into Ukraine's airspace. Last month, Mr Hammond told the Commons that the status of Ukraine was \"quite different\" from that of Nato countries. He said: \"Nato countries enjoy the Article 5 guarantee which protects and assures their security, but we are doing everything we can to reassure our Nato allies about the protection we offer.\" \"I am able to advise the House we have taken the decision to offer to Nato UK Typhoon aircraft to augment the Polish contribution to the Nato Baltic air policing mission.\" Later this week about 100 British troops will travel to Estonia to take part in a multi-national military exercise. The Ministry of Defence said this had been planned for some time. In Ukraine, pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country have released one of a team of eight European monitors seized in the flashpoint city of Sloviansk. The officer, a Swede, was freed on medical grounds, it has been confirmed.

A record 191 women were elected in 2015 - around 30% of MPs. Earlier this year, the election of Tory Trudy Harrison in Copeland took the number of women elected altogether in the past 100 years to 456 - roughly the same as the total number of male MPs in the 2015-2017 Parliament. General election: What you need to know Labour's draft election manifesto leaked MPs recommended in January that political parties should be fined if they failed to ensure at least 45% of their general election candidates were female. The Women and Equalities Committee said the fact that 30% of current MPs were women represented a \"serious democratic deficit\", for \"no good reason\" and called for a change in the law after the next general election if that figure did not increase \"significantly\". Both the Conservatives and Lib Dems are fielding a higher proportion of female candidates in the 2017 general election than they had as MPs in the last parliament. Just over 21% of the Conservative MPs elected in 2015-17 were women. Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chaired the Women and Equalities Committee in the last Parliament, told the World at One: \"The Conservative Party has made significant progress, particularly under Theresa May and the the work she's done with the Women2Win campaign.\" Mrs May was a founder of the campaign, which aims to increase the representation of women in the party, along with Tory peer Baroness Jenkin. The SNP is fielding 20 women out of 59 SNP candidates in Scottish seats, or 33.4%. In 2015, the SNP had 36 male MPs and 20 women (35.7%). The SNP's Kirsty Blackman told the BBC that the surprise timing of the election had meant \"less time to reach out to candidates from non-traditional backgrounds\". The Lib Dems lost all their female MPs in their near-wipeout in the 2015 election.

Part of the problem is that many of the people we trust to report on science don't have a solid understanding of statistics and the scientific method. As a result, I constantly come across articles that are misleading or, in some cases, completely false. What I'd like to do in this article is share some of most sensationalized articles I've come across in recent years and explain where the reporting went wrong.10. Housework Cuts Breast Cancer Risk \u2013 Based upon the title, you'd think that the only thing a woman needs to stave off breast cancer is a mop and bucket, right? This is a prime example of how people frequently confuse correlation with causation. Just because two variables are statistically associated does not mean that one is causing the other! It's possible that the association isn't meaningful at all or is explained by something else entirely (e.g., perhaps women who do more housework are just generally in better physical shape and that's what actually accounts for the lower cancer risk).9. Recession Causes Increase in Teen Dating Violence \u2013 Notice how the title says the recession \"causes\" dating violence. In the study this article was based on, the researchers found that 1 in 3 teens reported abuse or threat of abuse by a relationship partner. They also found that 3 in 4 teens reported that their families experienced economic problems in the last year. Based upon these two completely separate findings, it was concluded that the down economy \"caused\" the reported violence. This is an astoundingly poor leap in logic, and it doesn't take a degree in statistics to see that.8. Sexual Lyrics Prompt Teens to Have Sex \u2013 More correlation/causation confusion. Although listening to sexually explicit music was statistically associated with having sex at a younger age, it doesn't necessarily mean that raunchy music was \"prompting\" sex. There are a ton of other factors that could explain why these variables could be related (e.g., perhaps both are a function of low levels of parental supervision, different personality types, etc.).7. Facebook Causes 1 in 5 Divorces in the U.S. \u2013 More inappropriate use of the word \"causes\" (are you sensing a theme yet?). While Facebook may be increasingly cited as a factor in divorce cases, is Facebook really the \"cause\" of so many divorces, or is this just a reflection of the fact that many people cheat and Facebook simply provides a convenient way of doing it?6.

The paper obtained the figures from the Department of Justice after murderer Stephen Scott was seen at his mother's home in Warrenpoint at the weekend. It says that less than one in 10 requests for leave are turned down. TUV leader Jim Allister tells the Telegraph: \"In Northern Ireland, of course, such prioritising of prisoners is only too common.\" The department's website says: \"The range of temporary release schemes has been developed to provide both determinate and life sentence prisoners with structured and planned releases towards the end of their sentences.\" The News Letter says that Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson was cheered by fellow MEPs when he told them there is no legal entity called the north of Ireland. He was speaking during a European Parliament debate on a Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in-backed call for Northern Ireland to be given special status post Brexit. The amendment was rejected by 374 votes to 66, in what the paper calls a blow to Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's \"diplomatic offensive for designated special status\". The Irish News has the story of a health expert from Melbourne, who now lives in County Armagh and says he had to return to Australia to get a GP appointment. Jason Calvert, 29, has a rare lung condition and has been trying to get on the books of a practice in Portadown for the last year. However, he has been put on a waiting list and has not been given a letter of refusal which he needs to register with someone else. \"The irony is that I have private health insurance through work - but I can't get anything done because I need a GP referral,\" he tells the paper. As the Irish Open gets under way in Portstewart, all three papers, as well as the Daily Mirror, have pictures of Wednesday's Pro-am event. Among those pictured taking part are Pep Guardiola, Jimmy Nesbitt, Vernon Kay, Pat Jennings, AP McCoy and, to the delight of female spectators, Jamie Dornan. The Mirror says that, for once, the weather obliged and there were no shades of grey for actor Dornan. The News Letter reports that Tory MP and former Army officer Bob Stewart's life was saved by his son when INLA killers came to his house in the 1980s. He said they asked the 13-year-old if \"his daddy was home\", but his son lied and told them he was away at work. Plans to show horror movies such as The Exorcist and The Omen at a derelict Catholic Church on Belfast's Ormeau Road have been condemned by a priest, the Belfast Telegraph reports. The plan is part of the Belfast Film Festival. However, west Belfast priest Fr Patrick McCafferty asks: \"What is their motivation for showing these types of films in what was once a sacred building that will have such special memories of spiritual occasions for lots of people?\" The Irish News reports that a prominent barrister is due to be discharged from hospital after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest during a \"gruelling 24-hour race\" in Belfast at the weekend. It says Iryna Kennedy was about 32 miles into the event at Victoria Park in east Belfast when she became ill on Saturday. Finally, the Belfast Telegraph has the story of the rescue of a snake in the grass in County Down. Donaghadee woman Margaret McClean found the orange grass snake in her garden and wrapped it in a pillow case, saving it from a cat who had \"got it by the tail\". The paper says that the most common exotic pets in Northern Ireland are ring-tailed lemurs of which there are nine, while there are also six emus, five racoons, two tigers and one wolf.

To do so, we will have to think beyond particular candidates and specific elections. We will have to think more radically, to propose more fundamental reforms. The Constitution of 1787 offers far too many nooks and crannies in the cobwebbed architecture of our political system in which Republicans can hide out and bide their time before attempting another hostile takeover of our democracy. Because the founders-approved option of amending the Constitution is, for the time being, unavailable to us, we will have to figure out ways of amending it without formally amending it, in order to end the artificially enhanced prominence of a party that has been so malignant in its current form. Ad PolicyFirst, we need a plan to immediately end the gerrymandering of congressional districts. Without taking this step, there could be no hope of returning the people's chamber to the people's hands. If we wait until after the next census, in 2020, it will be too late. By then, even if the Democrats win by a landslide in 2016, the GOP will have returned.For starters, if they do not take back the House of Representatives in the fall, Democrats should file lawsuits in the courts arguing that the gerrymandering of congressional districts is a violation of the Constitution, which nowhere explicitly confers on the states the power to gerrymander, or even to create congressional districts.", "label": 0, "id": 101047}

{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery who refused on religious grounds to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple have paid about $144,000 in damages despite their ongoing appeal of the discrimination case, a state official said on Tuesday.The damages were ordered after Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of the Sweet Cakes by Melissa bakery, refused to bake a cake in 2013 when Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were planning their nuptials.Aaron Klein handed the state a check for nearly $137,000 on Monday, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries spokesman Charlie Burr said. The payment was first reported by the Oregonian newspaper late on Monday.The money was added to $7,000 received from the Kleins earlier this month through private collection efforts spearheaded by the state's Department of Justice, Burr told Reuters.After the owners' refusal to bake the cake, the state bureau found they had violated anti-discrimination laws because their shop is not a registered religious institution. It ordered them to pay the Bowman-Cryers $135,000 in damages.The Kleins appealed the ruling and had refused to pay the damages, citing financial hardship.Burr said the shop owners subsequently raised about $500,000 from supporters via an online crowdfunding effort.The damages had been accruing interest since the damages were ordered due in July. \"We were in touch with their attorneys in giving precise amounts in what they needed to pay to cease collection efforts,\" Burr said.The Kleins' lawyer, Tyler Smith, said the bakery owners are \"devoted to honoring God in every aspect of their lives, including how they conduct themselves in this litigation.\"In order to pursue their appeal, he said in an emailed statement, Oregon law requires that the Kleins either pay the damages or obtain a bond for the imposed amount.The least expensive option to stay in compliance with the law was to pay the funds that the labor bureau will hold in a separate account \"until they prevail in their court appeal,\" Smith said.Burr said the state will hold the damages until all appeals are settled. The case will go to the Oregon Court of Appeals next year and could ultimately go to the state's Supreme Court.The Bowman-Cryers were married in 2014 after a federal judge struck down Oregon's same-sex marriage ban.The bakery case is one of many disputes nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.", "label": 0, "id": 101052}
{"text": "During his visit to the US, he enveloped Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg in a massive hug and reprised the embrace with President Barack Obama in New York. In August, he hugged the crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,  inspiring some droll memes. Mr Modi has also hugged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The mother of all hugs came in January with a humongous embrace of President Obama. Delirious Indian news channels ran tickers screaming 'Modi/Obama hug' because, as The New York Times reported, \"this was not expected\". The newspaper dubbed the development as a \"quadrilateral security hug\". Whatever the case, Mr Modi has learned to stop worrying about public displays of affection when he meets the rich and the powerful: Google \"Modi hugging\", and it spits out more than 300,000 results in under a second. Indians and their politicians are not known for being so touchy-feely. Cuban leader Fidel Castro scandalised many Indians when he gave former prime minister Indira Gandhi a huge hug during a summit in Delhi in 1983. Mrs Gandhi, wrote a biographer Pranay Gupte, \"never an emotionally demonstrative person, visibly recoiled from the hug, managing only a faintly polite smile in the interest of diplomatic niceties\". Even Mr Modi was different in his early days as a party functionary in Delhi. Biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay remembers him as a \"warm and affectionate man and his overall body language touched a chord\". Much later, as the chief minister of Gujarat, he could be a \"bit cold and remote\" with his peers at meetings, \"shaking hands and maybe touching somebody on his shoulders if he knew somebody particularly well\". \"But this is different, this hugging spree. He was never so overt and aggressive in his public display of affection,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"His bear hugs are to convey the message that he's the representative of more than a billion Indians. He's saying 'I have demographic clout'. \"And he's sending the message back home that 'I am being respected around the world, so respect me at home and give me your votes'. It's a powerful piece of imagery.\" People see before they hear, and a leader's body language is a vital asset. The ritual of shaking hands is all about restraint and respect. Hugs go beyond the formal protocol - they show affection, comradeship and spontaneity. Mr Modi, clearly, believes that hugs fetch more dividends; they are not about cuddly politics alone. The body language is also tweaked to cater to different audiences. Sociologist Shiv Visvanathan says Mr Modi has three core audiences: the diaspora, foreign leaders and the Indian people. \"To the Indian masses, he speaks from a great distance. To the diaspora, he speaks with a sense of conviviality. To the world leaders, he changes his body language, gives them big hugs,\" says Dr Visvanathan. \"The effort is too obvious. He's trying to tell the world that he's an equal, a friend and he's very affectionate. Mr Modi is a performer. At the same time, he has become a caricature of himself. This worries me. I would like my leader to have more confidence.\" ", "label": 0, "id": 101053}

We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative.

{"text": "Mr Mutharika, who died in April, changed it to a full sun to reflect what he said was Malawi's move from a developing to a developed nation. A BBC reporter says the move was deeply unpopular with the people of Malawi. \"You cannot rewrite history midway for no apparent reason,\" the justice minister told the BBC after the vote. A former economist, Mr Mutharika governed Malawi for eight years, but had latterly been accused of mismanaging the economy and becoming autocratic. Following his death, his vice-president, Joyce Banda, took power and has reversed many of his policies. She had fallen out with Mr Mutharika over his succession plans and left his Democratic People's Party (DPP). The government bill to revert to the flag first hoisted at independence in 1964 was supported by all opposition parties - except the former ruling DPP. \"A flag has got a very fundamental significance,\" Justice Minister Ralph Kasambara told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. \"The flag is part of our association with the independence struggle, the history of the country,\" he said. He condemned Mr Mutharika's justification for changing the flag, adding that it was \"absurd\" to say Malawi was a prosperous country. The BBC's Joel Nkoma in Lilongwe says the President Banda has scored several political points with the move as most people he spoke to on the streets of the capital have welcomed the return of the old flag. The DPP says spending money on changing the flag again should not be a priority at a time the country is facing economic hardships. But our reporter says the DPP no longer has any political clout, having lost its parliamentary majority since President Banda took over after Mr Mutharika's sudden death from a cardiac arrest. At least half of its members have left to become independents - or crossed the floor to join President Banda's party, our correspondent says. President Banda needs to sign the bill before it becomes law. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day.

{"text": "Ever since the UPA government mooted the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP) in 2004, it has been a target of criticism from environmental advocates as well as religious enthusiasts. The project envisages excavating the shallow sea between the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar to create a narrow shipping passage, linking the east and west coasts of India and obviating the current 'hassle' of circumnavigating Sri Lanka to reach the eastern coast of India (and vice-versa).The total length of the channel is estimated to be 152.2 km. Creating it will require two phases of dredging (or even blasting, depending on the nature of the substratum) the 20-km-long coral-reef platform known as 'Adam's Bridge' or 'Ram Sethu', as some like to call it, and the 54-km long Bay of Bengal segments. The third segment falls in the Palk Bay, with a total length of 78 km and which reportedly requires no dredging as this area has a clearance depth of 12 m.Sethusamudram, as the name suggests, is that part of the ocean being constantly bridged by natural sedimentation processes. Like the Great Barrier Reef off of the northeast coast of Australia, Ram Sethu is a continuous stretch of limestone shoals that runs from the Pamban island near Rameswaram to Mannar Island off of the northern coast of Sri Lanka. Because the ocean floor is shallow in this area, natural processes have formed coral platforms here for millions of years.During a glaciation period 20,000 years ago, many parts of the Indian coast including, parts of Sethusamundram, may have been exposed above water. From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, seas level steadily rose around the world due to glaciers melting. As it did, the coral polyps could once again have grown higher on the newly submerged platforms. And in time, the platforms may have been used by human migrants to cross over the oceans. The Indian epic Ramayana refers to a putative land bridge in this region; believers hold it as the structure that Lord Ram and his army built to reach Lanka.An initially assessment by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) ruled out any environmental risk and certified the feasibility of the project. However, serious concerns have been raised from different quarters on the stability of the proposed canal and the environmental impact of this project. Its total cost is Rs 25,000 crore.Government agencies entrusted with this work at that time seemed to show an extraordinary enthusiasm, brushing aside uncomfortable questions and keeping the public in the dark about the canal's stability and adverse environmental impact. However, using an interim order in 2007, the Supreme Court had stayed the dredging of the Ram Sethu after admitting a plea that it had immense religious value for Hindus. Subsequently, the UPA government was compelled to constitute a committee in 2008 headed by R.K. Pachauri, then the director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute, to explore the possibility of an alternative route that would not affect Ram Sethu's integrity. His committee found that the project could pose a serious threat to the ecosystem", "label": 0, "id": 101060}
{"text": "Isabelle Sanders, 51, was stabbed to death by Paul McManus, 20, during a robbery at her home in Crookston. McManus was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 26 years. Ms Sanders' brother James Dougall says whole life terms would protect the public from violent criminals. During a trial at the High Court in Glasgow last year a jury heard that Ms Sanders was stabbed 37 times during the robbery. McManus was also convicted of attempting to murder her partner, Norman Busby, 86, and two robbery-related stabbings. After the trial, it emerged McManus had been released from a previous sentence just weeks before the murder. The judge who sentenced him highlighted his \"significant\" criminal record, which included convictions for theft, assault and robbery and the use of weapons. Lord Armstrong pointed out that the 20-year-old had already served seven sentences of detention. Ms Sanders' family has lodged a petition with Holyrood's petitions committee which they hope will attract widespread public support. Her brother, Mr Dougall, told BBC Scotland: \"It is maybe not applicable for every violent offender, but certainly for violent reoffenders who get the chance of early release and then go on to reoffend and who disregard that chance they have been given and go on to commit violent murder specifically. \"I think (in these cases) the whole of life sentence is an appropriate option for the judiciary and guidance should be given to them that they will be allowed to impose that type of sentence. \"So the petition we have started is 'life means life' - that judges have that option for whole of life sentencing in specific circumstances.\" Though not used in Scotland, whole life sentences are used by judges in England. The Scottish government has highlighted the fact that judges already have the power to impose a sentence which will exceed the rest of a person's life. A government spokesman said: \"Scottish courts have the power to impose the equivalent of a 'whole life tariff' in any given case. \"The independence of Scotland's judiciary is a fundamental part of the Scottish legal system. As such, sentencing is a matter for judges who operate independently of Scottish ministers and it is for our courts to decide what sentence to impose in each case before them. \"The Scottish government has previously announced the creation of a specific Scottish Sentencing Council which will promote consistency and transparency around sentencing and encourage better understanding of sentences across Scotland, as well as producing sentencing guidelines for the judiciary.\" ", "label": 0, "id": 101061}

The international terror threat scale was first made public in the UK in August 2006, just over a year after the London bombings that killed 52 people. There are five ratings at which the threat level can stand. Since its introduction, the level has never fallen below what is known as \"substantial\", and it hasn't been that low since August 2014. The highest level \"critical\" has been activated twice before. The threat level was first raised to \"critical\" on 10 August 2006, just nine days after the scale was published, following the discovery of a plot to blow up planes flying from Britain to the USA on as many as 10 flights. The only other time the threat level was raised to \"critical\" was following the car attack on Glasgow Airport on 30 June 2007, in which the only fatality was one of the assailants. On neither occasion was the threat maintained at that highest level for longer than four days. Before being moved up to \"critical\" on 23 May 2017, the threat level had been held at \"severe\" for 998 days. Low: 0 Moderate: 0 Substantial: 1331 Severe: 2610 Critical: 8 In September 2010, additional scales were introduced to rate the threat level from terrorism related to Northern Ireland. There is one scale for potential action within Northern Ireland and another for terrorist action on the Great Britain mainland. Currently those levels for the risk from terrorism associated with Northern Ireland, are assessed as \"severe\" within Northern Ireland and \"substantial\" for the GB mainland. The threat level for the UK from international terrorism is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), which is a self-standing organisation made up of representatives from 16 government departments and agencies. MI5 says the scale is intended to be a tool for security practitioners and the police to determine what security response may be required. Threat levels in themselves do not require specific responses from the public. The MI5 website says: \"Vigilance is vital regardless of the current national threat level,\" and that \"sharing national threat levels with the general public keeps everyone informed.\" It adds that making the threat level public \"also helps explain the context for the various security measures (for example airport security or bag searches) which we may encounter in our daily lives.\" The website urges members of the public with information about possible terrorist activity to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

{"text": "If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in \"\"Santa Fe Trail\"\", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's \"\"Little Big Man\"\". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - \"\"You take glory with you when it's your time to go\"\".\"", "label": 0, "id": 101088}

{"text": "But a childhood friend says he saw a marked change in Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, after he made a trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan several years ago. The Afghan-born American had returned a \"completely different person\", according to the friend. He seemed more stern and wore religious Muslim clothing. Mr Rahami lived with family members above his place of work, First American Fried Chicken, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Childhood friend Flee Jones said Mr Rahami had given him free food and space in the restaurant to hold rap contests. Mr Jones said Mr Rahami was formerly his basketball partner, but that he had changed after returning from trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"It's like he was a completely different person,\" Mr Jones told the New York Times. \"He got serious and completely closed off.\" Friends say Mr Rahami travelled to Quetta and Karachi, Pakistani cities that are home to a large community of Afghans who have fled conflict in their country. What we know so far Quetta is considered to be a haven for leaders from the exiled Afghan Taliban. According to US media reports, Mr Rahami married while in Pakistan. New Jersey congressman Albio Sires said Mr Rahami had contacted his office in 2014 during a visit to Pakistan. He said his constituent had requested help obtaining a visa to bring his spouse to the US since her Pakistani passport had expired. Citing law enforcement officials, CNN reported that Mr Rahami's wife had left the US in the days before the attacks. US officials are working with Pakistan and United Arab Emirates officials to contact her, according to the report. According to US media, Mr Rahami was found with a notebook that contained ramblings about terrorists following his arrest. It reportedly referred to the Boston Marathon bombers and also mentioned Anwar al-Awlaki, the American imam killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Mr Rahami attended Middlesex County College in Edison, New Jersey, where he majored in criminal justice, from 2010-12, but he did not graduate according to school officials. Recently he appeared to have been taking on more responsibility from his father in the running of First American Fried Chicken. But neighbours' complaints about rowdy behaviour from patrons outside the all-night takeaway spot led city officials to pass an ordinance requiring the place to shut at 10pm each night. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said Mr Rahami's father had sued the city in 2011 over the ordinance. He said he had been ethnically discriminated against, but lost the case. This is not Ahmad Khan Rahami's first encounter with law enforcement. In 2014, he was arrested on weapons and aggravated assault charges after he allegedly stabbed someone in the leg in a domestic incident, court documents showed. Another patron of the fried chicken restaurant, Ryan McCann, said the bombing loved talking about his souped-up Honda Civic. \"He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary,\" said Mr McCann.

{"text": "Three major state museums in St. Petersburg \u2014 The Hermitage, The Catherine's Palace in Pushkin and The Russian museum \u2014 see visitors lined up in long queues. What's normal for summer time looks unbelievable under current weather conditions with 20 C under zero. An even half an hour wait may cause light freezing injury (we've tested it ourselves), but visitors prefer standing for once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see works by Aivazovsky or the Amber room.Taking a picture of the queues is not easy as a camera's battery becomes low very fast. Under minus 20 degrees Celsius, the equipment doesn't want to work long and prefers to get switched off after 40 shots and 15 minutes.St. Petersburg authorities and non-governmental organizations opened stations where homeless people can come and warm up to avoid injuries or death from low temperatures. The St. Petersburg circle road administration issued a warning that the icy road increases the risk of traffic accidents and limited the speed on the road to 70 km\\h instead of ordinary 110. The emergency service and transport companies are on high alert. The demand for heating units and felt boots has significantly increased since the low temperatures period started two days ago.It's even more surprising to see long queues for the biggest and most popular museums in St. Petersburg at the times when most people prefer staying home.The queue for The State Hermitage museum was no less than 300 meters long (including a part in an inner yard where the entrance to the museum is). You can see the queue on cover picture.The day on which the photo was taken was January 5, a free admission day which can partly explain the love for standing about an hour in line getting face, arms and legs gradually frozen. Though on Wednesday the queue was reported to be of the same length.The Russian museum is a bit less popular, but anyway has its own nearly one hundred meters line. The visitors are being allowed in by portions due to overcrowded space inside. Pictured also on January 5.The Catherine's Palace featuring the Amber room has also a superb park that's worth visiting at any time of the year (in the winter the entrance is free). Though we could not find strengths to join the queue to visit the museum as a 10 minute walk in the park on January 4 under -19 C urgently prompted us to a cup of coffee and half a liter of hot mulled wine at a nearby coffeeshop. And the camera's battery had become low though it indicated a full charge before leaving out.That all is rather strange even for many Russians themselves, but true.We can offer only two explanations to why people prefer standing lined up for often over an hour wait to see arts and sometimes with kids (!).St. Petersburg is one of the most popular destinations within Russia for the long January holidays. Many people are coming here from across the country to visit museums which the city is well known for and not willing to miss the opportunity", "label": 0, "id": 101104}

GLIFAA President Regina Jun and Atlantic Council Executive Vice President Damon Wilson also spoke.Berry in his speech noted that a dozen countries now contribute to the Global Equality Fund, a public-private partnership the State Department manages with USAID to promote LGBT rights around the world.The LGBT Core Group at the U.N. includes two-dozen countries and an observer state. An international LGBT rights conference that is scheduled to take place in Uruguay in July is expected to draw advocates and officials from around the world.Berry specifically applauded Chile, Colombia and other Latin American countries for advocating for LGBT-specific issues on the U.N.

{"text": "A film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />I saw \"\"Random Hearts\"\" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (\"\"Star Wars,\"\" \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\"\" \"\"The Fugitive,\"\" \"\"Air Force One,\"\" \"\"Patriot Games\"\") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (\"\"Forrest Gump,\"\" \"\"Back To The Future\"\") in his summer 2000 thriller, \"\"What Lies Beneath,\"\" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy's \"\"The Sum Of All Fears.\"\" 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack (\"\"Out of Africa,\"\" \"\"The Firm,\"\" \"\"Tootsie\"\") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas' congresswoman. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see \"\"Eyes Wide Shut\"\" as well).<br /><br />Kristin Scott-Thomas (\"\"The English Patient,\"\" \"\"The Horse Whisperer\"\") shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by \"\"Heat\"\" actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.<br /><br />The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's \"\"The Firm\"\") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (\"\"A River Runs Through It\"\") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. \"\"Random Hearts\"\" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)\"", "label": 0, "id": 101108}

Americans and Canadians have been traveling to Mexico for many years to receive safe, successful bariatric surgery, and we keep going back.Be informed, ask lots of questions, and do as much planning as possible to minimize risk associated with medical travel.The following are important safety considerations.General Safety in MexicoIt's tempting to believe blanket statements like \"Mexico is dangerous,\" but that would be the same thing as saying that \"all cities and towns in the United States are dangerous.\" Despite the scary news stories, much of Mexico is very safe.Like the U.S. and Canada, Mexico is a huge country with some safe cities and some cities with a higher crime rate. And like U.S. and Canadian cities, conditions change from year to year.Click here for State Department warnings by Mexican province.Accreditation for Mexico Weight Loss SurgeryThe Joint Commission, the most respected and demanding hospital accreditation agency in the U.S., has an international division called the Joint Commission International (JCI) that accredits hospitals in Mexico.To receive certification, hospitals abroad must pass detailed testing for 300 standards with 1,200 specific data points that JCI surveyors examine and score. Here is a general overview of what's reviewed:Access to care and continuity of carePatient and family rightsAssessment of patientCare of patientsAnesthesia and surgical careMedical management and usePatient and family educationQuality improvement and patient safetyPrevention and control of infectionsGovernance, leadership, and directionFacility management and staffStaff qualifications and educationManagement of communication and informationIf a hospital outside the U.S. is JCI accredited, you know that they have passed the on-site 3 to 5 day hospital review within the last 3 years. This is an indicator you are traveling to a hospital where they put a premium on safe practice. There are a total of 4 hospitals in Mexico that are JCI approved and perform weight loss surgery.For further information on JCI accreditation, check out their website to get a better idea of their impressive standards. (Joint Commission International accreditation standards).Achieving JCI accreditation is an expensive, lengthy and rigorous process for a hospital. Most hospitals don't have the means to pursue JCI. Fortunately, there is another credentialing agency that screens hospitals for excellence.The Mexican Ministry of Health offers a reputable accreditation known as the CSG (El Consejo de Salubridad General, which means \"The General Health Council\") that is modeled after JCI accreditation. CSG has a specific set of standards to address international patient safety. CSG accreditation serves as an indicator that you're going to a well respected hospital with a safe track record.We ran a survey on 20 Mexican hospitals and clinics that perform bariatric surgery and found that 8 are CSG accredited, which means that less than half of your options fall in the accredited category.Non-Accredited Options for Bariatric Surgery MexicoWhat if your prospective hospital or clinic lacks certification from either the JCI or CSG?Rest assured, there are great clinics and hospitals that are not accredited for a variety of reasons.

But in their zeal to drive Donald into the ground, the media wouldn't let go.Unfortunately, Trump's famously thin skin doesn't allow him to explain himself, as he could in thirty seconds, not that the MSM would give him a chance anyway. They are so appalled by his candidacy that they won't let one idea leak through lest their sainted favorite, Mrs. Clinton, look bad by comparison. She is running an ideas-free campaign, particularly in the area of foreign policy where her record from Iraq to Libya to Iran, as Trump pointed out in Monday's speech, is atrocious. Thus the press resorts to unending attacks on Trump's rhetoric with the blinded American people as the victims.But more of that in a moment. First, the speech, which was a good one and delivered with a teleprompter. (Every morning, before he does anything else, Trump should kneel down, clasp his hands together, and recite to himself: \"The teleprompter is my friend.\")The key part of the address was the welcome specificity on Muslim immigration. Some of his earlier pronouncements on the subject were more explosive than necessary, though they did bring attention to a subject on which most leaders are afraid to speak, for which Trump deserves credit.What Trump now is aiming for is what he calls \"extreme vetting\" of potential Muslim immigrants to keep us safe. What does that mean, besides being extra careful and erring on the side of \"no\"? To begin with, it means not being afraid to profile, something the current administration considers anathema. But Trump was indeed more specific. He cited Sharia law as being incompatible with the Constitution and values of our country, which indeed it is, and said all adherents of Sharia should be kept out. Good.Trump made a comparison here to the Cold War, when communism called for the violent overthrow of the U.S. government. Sharia and jihad, in their extreme forms, indeed in practically all forms if you read carefully, call for the same thing, but on a religious basis. (One of the most bizarre ironies of our time is that the left seeks to protect Sharia with all its rampant and repugnant misogyny and homophobia. I'd love to see Bill Clinton try to explain that one. He might break the world record for parsing.)Trump also called for working with allies to defeat ISIS, again specifically naming Israel as our greatest ally in the area before he cited any others. (Can you imagine the Bushes, say, doing that?) He recommended working with NATO as well -- an organization he had accused of being now irrelevant because of a failure to address terrorism.

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.

Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\"Nevermind that the American people had elected President Obama with a clear majority in 2012 for just this purpose.Following suit in a televised debate on CBS later that night, the Republican candidates for the White House were unanimous in their insistence that a \"lame duck\" president should not have the power to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.Ted Cruz claimed there are \"80 years of precedent of not confirming justices in an election year\".As Elizabeth Williamson points out, \"It's not clear what Mr. Cruz was talking about (and some Republican Senators were also making that claim). Justice Anthony Kennedy was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 after his two previous nominations of Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg collapsed. He was confirmed in 1988, during an election year, when Democrats controlled the Senate.\"Indeed, Justice Kennedy's confirmation included \"yea\" votes from Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, who will oversee the incoming confirmation process.Perhaps forgetful of his own voting record, Sen. Grassley said on Saturday:\"The fact of the matter is that it's been standard practice over the last 80 years to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a presidential election year.\"Of course, as steadfast hypocrisy goes, this only gets better.The late Justice Antonin Scalia was nominated by President Reagan in July of 1986 and confirmed on September 17th, just 48 days before Election Day, when Democrats regained control of the Senate.There was no bickering over \"unfairness\" of the process. There was no demand that President Reagan, a lame duck Commander-in-Chief facing the prospect of losing the Senate, wait until the next session of Congress to put forth his nominee.There was the Constitutional mandate of the President and the duty of the Congress to confirm or reject the President's nominee.Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, then the junior and much more youthful members of that legislative body, had no such qualms with the process. Both voted for confirmation of Justice Scalia.And in the years since, neither senator has expressed regret over that decision.This is the modus operandi of Congressional Republicans.

{"text": "After Tuesday's play-off defeat at Luton, she said she would not go into partnership with Wrexham Supporters' Trust (WST) to buy the club. Her spokesman said she had received death threats, not reported to police, after becoming involved with Wrexham. Mrs Booth's withdrawal comes on the same day a winding-up order against the club was dismissed. The order, brought by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, was dismissed at a short hearing at the High Court in London after Wrexham paid off its \u00a3200,000 tax bill last month. This was done through a combination of donations and loans, but despite this, ownership of the club still needs to be resolved. Mrs Booth, who runs hotels and other businesses in the Llangollen, Wrexham and Mold areas, has been linked with the takeover for several months. The club first announced it was looking for a buyer in January when owner Geoff Moss and chairman Ian Roberts said they were stepping down from the board. Several bidders have said they are interested. Former footballer Ashley Ward, who started his career at the club, said he had held preliminary talks while businessman Stephen Cleeve outlined his interest on the Red Passion website. But since Mrs Booth and the trust announced they would work together they have been seen to be favourites. Last month the club survived a \u00a3200,000 tax demand when the money was paid off thanks to a combination of donations and loans. It cleared the way for the team to take part in the end-of-season promotion play-offs but Tuesday's defeat to Luton dashed hopes of a return to the Football League. After the defeat Mrs Booth said she was withdrawing from attempts to buy the club. She told BBC Radio Wales when she first launched her solo bid for the club the financing was in place. She said she was then asked to form a joint bid with the trust. \"I've urged them to meet and discuss the detail. They have declined and they've been meeting with two property developers. \"Why would two out-of-town property developers with no links to Wrexham want to buy a loss-making football club? She said her bid involved moving the football club and its assets - including the Racecourse and Colliers Park - into community ownership. \"It's never ever, ever going to make money as a football club or as a joint football and rugby club. \"[The Racecourse is] an important asset and it should be used for more than 3,000 people. \"It should be used by the population of Wrexham town.\" Spencer Harris, board member of WST, said: \"As a board of supporters, we've seen some of the statements made in the press by Stephanie Booth this morning and I have to say we're really disappointed that Stephanie would conduct herself in this way. \"I guess the key things are the board of the Wrexham Supporters Trust only ever received an outline proposal from Stephanie. \"That proposal lacked any detail and a formal proposal of what she was actually suggesting or putting to us never in fact materialised.\" He said WST was \"willing to talk to anybody who's got the interest of Wrexham Football Club at heart\" and would hold a public meeting on Tuesday at the William Aston Hall to make its position clear.

The crash led many Chinese to accuse the government of putting development and profit before safety. It also triggered a wave of popular anger against officials who were accused of trying to cover up the seriousness, and causes, of the crash. After receiving the report, China's cabinet criticised the railways ministry for lax safety standards and poor handling of the crash, according to Reuters. Premier Wen Jiabao was presented with the official investigation's conclusions at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The accident occurred after one train stalled following a lightning strike, and then a second high-speed train ran into it. Four carriages were thrown off a viaduct. The report found that serious design flaws in control equipment and improper handling of the lightning strike led to the crash. More serious penalties could follow for some of the 54 officials criticised in the report. Among the officials singled out was the former railways minister, Liu Zhijun, who was sacked before the crash, accused of corruption. Liu \"has the main leadership responsibility for the accident,\" the report says. Following the accident, the authorities called a temporary halt to new high-speed rail projects and placed speed restrictions on trains. China had planned to lay 16,000km (10,000 miles) of high-speed track by 2015, which would make it the biggest high-speed rail network in the world. It had hoped to make its rapidly developing railway technology an export success: Chinese train companies were aspiring to compete with Germany's Siemens and Canada's Bombardier by selling their technologies to foreign companies. But after July's crash that looks less likely. The railways ministry said on Friday that it planned to invest 400 billion yuan ($63bn; \u00c2\u00a340bn) in infrastructure construction in 2012, which is lower than the figure for this year.

RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: \"The savage cuts due to be announced tomorrow will leave every job across London Underground at risk and, if they are not stopped, will reduce the Tube network to a dangerous and hollowed-out shell where safety is compromised and passengers are left at risk the minute they step on to a station or a train. \"With increased passenger demand, against the background of a Tube capacity that is struggling to cope, we need more staff, not less, and this package of Treasury-driven cuts would send London Underground right over the edge.\" In March, BBC London reported TfL is facing a 1% cut in its government grant this year, and 2% the following year. In cash terms, it means a loss of \u00a333m for 2013-14, and \u00a345m for 2014-15. In January passengers saw on average a 4.2% increase in fares across the Tube, buses and trams. LU managing director Mike Brown said: \"We are now carrying more passengers, more safely and reliably than ever before. \"Major modernisation of the Tube is well under way and many of our customers benefit today from some of the most frequent rail services anywhere in Europe. \"We will shortly set out our vision for a Tube service fit for the future and London in the 21st Century. \"This will include a commitment that all Tube stations will remain staffed and managed while services are running, with more staff visible and available to help our customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and remain safe and secure.\" ", "label": 0, "id": 101133}

But the withdrawal of a \u00a34m Heritage Lottery Fund bid has prompted fears within the museum community that the centre could be in danger. The county council said the funding came with strings attached and Snibston was part of a wider review of museums. The award-winning museum is the most visited in the county, but some of the buildings were included on English Heritage's most recent At Risk register. The funding bid had been for a \u00a35m project called Mining Lives, which would have improved the condition of the colliery buildings and increased public access to the site. Mark Taylor, from the Museums Association, said: \"I just hope they have thought this through and they have left room to change their minds. \"Because it seems to me that when you are going to get \u00a35m to improve your flagship museum it breaks your heart if you have to send that back, especially if the real reason is that you want to close that museum.\" The council, which needs to save to save \u00a395m, said a review of the county's museums was taking place but there were no plans to close the centre.

Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br />Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though, there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters.

{"text": "\"If Europe fails on the question of refugees, then it won't be the Europe we wished for,\" she said. She was speaking after Austrian authorities arrested five suspected people smugglers along the country's eastern borders. On Thursday, 71 dead migrants were found near the Hungarian border. Austrian police say more than 200 others were found alive overnight. Ms Merkel said European countries must share the burden of refugees. Germany is the main destination for migrants arriving on the EU's eastern borders and expects the number of asylum seekers it receives to quadruple to about 800,000 in 2015. Mrs Merkel said \"Germany is a strong country - we will manage.\" But she said there would be \"no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people\" after a spate of arson attacks on refugee shelters and anti-migrant demonstrations. \"The number of people... helping strangers get through cities and communities and even taking them into their homes is far greater than the number of xenophobes,\" she went on. Mrs Merkel's call for greater co-operation was echoed by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who warned that Europe's migrant crisis would be a \"long and difficult challenge\". Also on Monday, trains from Budapest carrying hundreds of migrants were stopped at the Austrian frontier. Austria's rail service OeBB said the route from Budapest was facing severe disruption due to \"overcrowding\". Austrian police said they would turn back anyone on board who had made a request for asylum in Hungary - but it is not clear if this actually happened. Once in Austria, migrants would have two weeks to decide whether or not they wanted to claim refugee status there, police said. Trains were later allowed to proceed and hundreds of migrants arrived in Vienna on Monday evening. Many of them immediately boarded trains bound for Germany. Austria also introduced extra checks on vehicles entering from Hungary on Sunday evening, causing long traffic jams on Hungary's major roads leading to the Austrian border. The Austrian checks appear to undermine the EU's Schengen system, which normally allows unrestricted travel. But in exceptional circumstances countries can reintroduce border controls under Schengen. Austria's Interior Ministry told the BBC the checks would not be necessary if there were an agreement to distribute the migrants fairly. The head of the European Union's police agency, Rob Wainwright, said catching people smugglers would be easier with more \"effective\" border controls but added that the Schengen system had pros and cons. Five people have been detained in connection with the deaths of 71 people, most of them thought to be Syrians, in a lorry found last week on the A4 at Parndorf. Austria was shocked by the gruesome nature of the deaths. Thousands rallied on Monday demanding better rights for migrants. As well as the bodies in the lorry in Austria, hundreds more people drowned in the Mediterranean last week while trying to reach Europe from Libya. A record number of 107,500 migrants reached the EU's borders in July. The UN says the continuing conflict in Syria is a major factor behind the rise in migrant numbers. Greece, Italy and Hungary have particularly struggled with the surge of migrants from not only Syria but the rest of the Middle East and Africa. An extraordinary meeting of EU interior ministers is to be held on 14 September. Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Some governments have refused to take in refugees and resisted EU proposals to agree on a common plan. Others are tightening their policies on asylum and border security, sometimes because of rising anti-immigration sentiment. On Sunday France condemned Hungary for building a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia to try to keep out migrants travelling north from Greece via the Balkans. UK Home Secretary Theresa May blamed the Schengen system - which the UK did not join - for \"exacerbating tragedies\". She has demanded tighter EU rules on free movement. ", "label": 0, "id": 101146}

This will make India one of the top five performing HNWI markets in the world over this period (in terms of percentage of HNWI growth), along with Vietnam, Sri Lanka, China and Mauritius,\" it said.The 135 per cent rise will be fuelled by strong growth in the local financial services, professional services and media sectors.The main factors that encourage wealth growth in a country include, strong ownership rights and the country scored 9/10 in this metric, followed by strong economic growth (9/10).A well-developed banking system and stock market was also a factor as it encourages the people to invest their money within a country and grow their wealth locally, the report said.The report however, noted that excessive government regulations are a major hurdle for new businesses in India.\"Corruption is also a major problem \u2013 businesses often need to pay regular bribes to government officials in order to operate successfully.

The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film.

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence.

I regret not seeing this on the big screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have.

Instead, he started his career as a running coach; first at Portland's Franklin High School, then at his alma mater, Medford High School. After a tour of duty in Italy during World War II, Bowerman returned a hero and was recruited to replace Hayward at the University of Oregon upon the elder coach's retirement.Bowerman pioneered a training method now used by the majority of running coaches: instead of pushing athletes day after day, Bowerman allowed for \"easy\" and \"hard\" workout days and focused on each person's specific needs and goals. Author Kenny Moore adds in his book \" Bowerman and the Men of Oregon \" that Bowerman's approach was like that of a \"physical scientist,\" and that he constantly evolved his strategies.Through this method, which also pioneered the use of film to analyze performance, Bowerman \"developed and guided 24 NCAA individual champions, won four national team titles and coached the U.S. track and field team in the 1972 Olympic Games ,\" according to his biography at the National Distance Running Hall of Fame, to which Bowerman was inducted in 2002.Bowerman wanted to create lighter apparel and shoes for his runners, and went to a local shoemaker for guidance. Bowerman created the first lightweight outsole shoe from some latex, leather, glue and his wife's waffle iron, and Nike, first known as Blue Ribbon Sports, was born . It was a joint venture between Bowerman and the Oregon half-miler Phil Knight, who tested some of Bowerman's earliest pairs, and remains the chairman and CEO of Nike today.Bowerman's innovations indelibly altered the future of running shoes . \"From 1917, when Keds, the first popularly marketed sneaker, was introduced, until the 1960's, sports footwear underwent little change,\" The New York Times obituary of Bowerman notes.In addition, Bowerman's book \"Jogging,\" published in 1967, helped spur a running boom in the U.S.", "label": 0, "id": 101165}

{"text": "*Criticism does mention spoilers*<br /><br />I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project, Angelina.<br /><br />If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.\"", "label": 0, "id": 101175}

While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.\"", "label": 0, "id": 101180}
{"text": "Charles Dunne and Chris Cadden were on target before Morton's Gary Harkins was shown a straight red card. Richard Tait and Louis Moult added second-half goals. Elsewhere, Kris Boyd bagged a double as Kilmarnock won 2-0 at Annan Athletic to move top of Group E, and Hamilton won a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw at home to Queen of the South in Group G. In the other Group E match, Clyde beat Dumbarton 2-1, while Queen's Park overcame Edinburgh City 3-0 at Hampden in Group F and Albion Rovers won 5-2 at East Kilbride in Group G. Premiership side Motherwell quickly took control at home to Championship outfit Morton, with summer signing Dunne nodding home before Cadden finished after excellent build-up play. Harkins was dismissed for a poor challenge on Craig Tanner and Well made Jim Duffy's side pay after the break. Tait produced a fine finish for the third and substitute Moult netted an excellent free-kick to complete the scoring and take the hosts a point clear of their opponents at the top of the group. League One Queen's Park went third with a comfortable win over League Two Edinburgh City. Dominic Docherty got the scoring started from close range and a Chris McKee own goal doubled the Spiders' lead before Anton Brady's dig from distance put the result beyond doubt. At Galabank, Killie found their feet early on and the excellent Dominic Thomas set up Boyd for a simple finish. The Ayrshire side dominated the match but only added one more goal, with Boyd drilling an effort into the bottom corner after 62 minutes. Clyde are third in Group E, also on six points, following their win over Dumbarton. Craig Barr nodded Chris Johnstone's delivery home to give the Sons the lead but Darren Miller squared it with a cracker into the top corner. Max Wright headed the winner after 67 minutes. In Group G, Hamilton took the lead against Queen of the South thanks to an 88th-minute Steven Boyd goal, but Stephen Dobbie replied a minute later to ensure both sides earned at least one point. The Premiership side took the bonus point with a 6-5 win in the penalty shootout. Queen of the South are top of the group, having played a game more than Accies, who are third. Albion Rovers are second following their 5-2 triumph at East Kilbride. Goals from Alan Trouten and Gary Fisher gave the visitors an early two-goal lead and Connor Shields made it 3-0 after the break. Shields added his second before Sean Winter's goal and a Michael McMullin own goal gave East Kilbride hope. Shields, however, completed his hat-trick soon after to seal the win. The eight group winners and four best runners-up progress to the knockout stage where they are joined by the four teams in European competition - Celtic, Aberdeen, Rangers and St Johnstone. Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: \"We're happy, especially with the manner of the win. Our workrate and energy to win the ball back was the biggest thing for me. \"Louis Muolt has come on in two games and scored two goals, but we still want to add to the squad. I still feel there's more to come. \"(Moult) is a Motherwell player at the moment until someone tells me different. It will be the right amount of money or he will stay and you can see by his performances, workrate and attitude that he's 100% committed to us. \"We set a marker today where we want to make it horrible for teams to come here, we want to press the life out of them and make it a real competitive game. More than any passing, it was their attitude to win the ball back and their organisation, that was a really pleasing aspect.\" ", "label": 0, "id": 101181}

{"text": "In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phr\u00edobh\u00e1ideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around \u20ac5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to \u20ac25,000 per year.

{"text": "I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.<br /><br />I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias, I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br /><br />Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br /><br />Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br /><br />In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor, laugh and be merry.<br /><br />Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work watch it. If not watch something else...\"", "label": 0, "id": 101187}

Gunner James Motherwell of the 51st Division Ammunition Column, Royal Field Artillery, 51st Highland Division, died on 18 October, 1916, aged 32.

{"text": "Review: Against Me!, 'Transgender Dysphoria Blues'toggle caption Ryan Russell/Courtesy of the artistThe bracingly political Florida punk band Against Me! has been a going concern since 1997, but Transgender Dysphoria Blues can't help but feel like a debut: It's the group's first album since singer Tom Gabel came out as a woman. Now named Laura Jane Grace, she still barks her lyrics with fiercely assertive intelligence \u2014 with a voice as yet largely unchanged from the one in the band's earlier work \u2014 but Against Me!'s subject matter can't help but be turned on its head.It's right there in Transgender Dysphoria Blues' title that Against Me! intends to address Grace's new identity upfront: This is a coming-out record first and foremost, from its opening line \u2014 \"Your tells are so obvious / shoulders too broad for a girl\" \u2014 through songs that channel her fears and characteristic defiance. At times joltingly profane, Transgender Dysphoria Blues doesn't let up for 29 brisk minutes, but real tenderness and vulnerability surfaces in the melee. In \"Unconditional Love,\" Grace repeats the self-lacerating line, \"Even if your love was unconditional / it still wouldn't be enough to save me\" \u2014 a terrifying and revealing notion, even as Grace remains by all accounts happily married to her wife.Against Me!'s music only addressed gender issues in passing before Transgender Dysphoria Blues, so the album certainly qualifies as a left turn. But the end result is just as catchy and anthemic as the terrific speedball punk records that precede it. Gabel always told the truth as he saw it, so it makes sense that Laura Jane Grace would do the same, with the added benefit of comfort and courage in her own skin.", "label": 0, "id": 101198}
{"text": "If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called \"\"Outlaw Seas\"\" or \"\"The Outlaw Sea\"\", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. Two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway, it's fascinating reading.<br /><br />Horrifying story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble releasing enough Oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain.
